 Congrats! And good luck!  
 There's always the possibility of going 0 Nic;p
I Vape 0 Nic 100 VG liquids since 4 months now, I don't need to Vape and I have no urge when I don't Vape for some days, but I always come back to my 0 nics since I like it Way more and substitute it for my Shisha Smoking:)
Congrats to quitting bro, you made the right choice for your Body:) 
 Proud of you my dude! 
 I don't know if I'll ever fully quit, as I vape when I crave food (which is often)
Congrats man. You beat big tobacco. You've accomplished what millions of other can't. We're all proud of you! 
 Awesome job! Congrats :) 
 You left out the most important detail. What nicotine level is the juice? It sounds like it?s too high for that tank. Your best bet is to either lower the nicotine concentration (to 3mg/ml for example), or to get a higher-ohm coil like you said. I?m assuming you?re using 12mg or 18mg juice?  
 12mg  
 Also, if you do want to give 3mg/ml juice a try, you may also want to go with a higher-VG blend. Something like 70/30. PG is harsher than VG.  
 I will buy 1.8ohm and see thank you. most people say that the tank that comes with SMOK R80 is better suited for direct to lung. Do you recommend a better tank that's suited for mouth to lung to get a closer feeling to real cigarettes ?  
 I like the [Prism T22 tank](https://www.mtbakervapor.com/tanks/innokin-prism-t22-clearomizer/). It has no adjustments, only one coil option, and works great at 10-15 watts. 
But it?s also the only MTL tank I have any experience with besides the older Kanger Protank. 
Before getting another tank, give the SMOK 1.8? coils a shot. They might work great.  
 Awesome! thanks. 
 I edited my comment while you were replying. Yeah, try switching to the 1.8? coil, or try lower nicotine juice. 
Or try both! See what you like more. 
 Your coil is sub-ohm and the nicotine content is way too high for that! I would recommend getting 3mg nic if you don't want to change the coil to mouth to lung, say if you like the clouds of sub-ohm. Too high nicotine changes the flavour and can hurt the throats at sub-ohm.  
 Maybe I'm paranoid but I always subtract 10% from the safe amp rating of the battery so if mooch has rated a battery as good for 20A I'll build as if the battery was only good for 18A 
 While I haven't tried this firmware on my RX2/3, I have it installed on my VTC Mini & VTwo Mini. Fantastic update, highly recommended! 
 It really is a great improvement. Smoother Stainless TC, and a lot of options that it didn't have with stock wismec firmware. You can change temperature in 5 degree F increments, and 2 degree Celsius. 
 It will go to 200W with 2 batteries and to 250W with 3 batteries. The official firmware also goes to 200 and 250W when updated. 
 Instructions unclear: dick stuck in download folder. 
 From the readme it looks like it doesn't work with *all* rx200s. The original isn't listed 
 You're absolutely right. Incompatible with the smaller screen. It also seems to improve the TC. I've only tried it in SS. It also has a nickel ferrite tc setting, in the advanced options. Highly recommend it, if it works with your mod. 
 I use it on my Dual...  Works great... Love it... Much better than factory... 
 It's night and day on the RX 2/3. A big improvement. 
 Did this on my 2/3 last week and love it, works like a charm.
 Im using this on my cuboid and my RX 2/3. Really great firmware. 
 Yep ditto. Got it on my Cuboid and RX200S. Although neither has seen the light of day since I got my Triade! ? 
 Works great on my RX2/3!!! Thanks dude!!! Been playing around for an hour now :D 
 The FDA HATES Him! Check Out ONE Download That Gets You Rips In 5 MINUTES!  edit: Thanks for the clock!! Been wanting a mod with a clock for a while. 
 How would it improve tc isn't they the hardware  
 No. A big part of it is code and algorithms. It's based on the evic interface with the big analog clock screensaver. But, the clock is at the bottom of the home screen.  
 O sweet. Thanks I'll throw it on my rx200s 
 Follow the instructions. I had to load it twice on mine. It crashed the 1st time. Don't worry if this happens. Try, try, again! 
 Just a slight correction: Arctic Horizon tank with a 0.5ohm coil. 
 Btw, it says Doughnut Pounder on the bottle, not Powder.  
 Sorry for my phone's autocorrect. 
 Awesome! I look forward to the results, when you get to the 3000s... 
 Are most lipo's rewraps? Those all look like energy bars. 
 I <3 mooch! 
 I <3 mooch! too! 
 Do...Do people vape with those? 
 yup, pretty common with the dna200/250 mod 
 Seriously? How many Amps are they pulling on those things...Those batteries are definitely kind of scary 
 Generally about 20 amps I'd say. But yeah, they shoot fire. Terrifyingly brilliant.  
 Some say they go as high as 50+ amps 
 That is absolutely terrifying 
 Why? 
 50 Amps is an enormous amount of current to be flowing through something in the palm of your hand, that is supposed to get super hot. 
 Those batteries are specifically designed to discharge at high current.  
 50 amps on a 3S lipo pack (the type used by DNA200) is upwards of 500w. You have to remember, these lipo packs are 3 cells in series, so they have a voltage of 11.1v.Under normal vaping circumstances (under/around 100w) you'll be pulling no more than 10 amps.
 I know but I meant they are suppose to handle up to 50 amps, well at least some of them. 
 No problem at all! 
 I was hoping you would do the 1500 mah nano tech but the 1800 is pretty close! 
 Ah man thank you so much, Mooch! I feel like I had something to do with this after the message I sent you yesterday. Looking forward to it!  
 Kinda curious about the efest lipos that imrbatteries is selling at half off 
 900mAh packs? 
 Yeah! 
 I don't know if I'll be testing the smaller ones for a while. Probably not this year. 
 Fair enough... I just figured there are probably a decent amount of them in circulation in the smaller DNA 200 devices and it would be relevant. But I understand there is only so much time and you only have certain batteries. 
 I usually first test the batteries that are requested most often. I've only received a couple of requests to test those over the past several months.
They are used a lot in the DNA devices but the DNA's have their own battery analyzer and most DNA users just replace with the same battery because there are only a couple of choices for lipo's that fit. I do hope to test the 900-1300mAh batteries though. 
 Hey mooch, love your work.Do you know if you're going to be testing some of the 'mini' size packs? The 900mah ones? 
 Not sure yet. Not this year though as my backlog is already about 6-8 weeks. 
 Don't do it. I fly RC and i've used LIPo's for years and i simply wouldn't do this for safety reasons. It's only a matter of time until you get a fail and it could actually kill you dead. I've seen them explode without warning and catch fire and spew napalm everywhere. I hope you know about cell balancing and Max discharge and residual current requirements. Please don't make your next post from the burns unit...  
 PG is a better flavour carrier but nothing wrong with vaping pure VG. Some people have PG allergies and can only vape pure VG. You will still get flavour just slightly muted.  
 The answer as I understand it is not necessarily -- one of the best vapes I ever had was a pink lemonade in pure VG, but the shop had a PhD Chemist on staff who new which flavors and molecules bonded best with VG vs. PG. So it is possible to get great flavor with VG but you have to know a LOT of chemistry. 
 I disagree. I know *very very* little chemistry but my home diy juice in VG is perfectly fine. I just use a little higher % flavour in the mix vs a pg/vg blend.
 For that price, and all the access they have to data all over the world, they could offer age verification. 
 Hope this changes, but isn't the signature/attorney/etc...all happening after January 15th? 
 Still haven't heard anything from mine but I am crossing my fingers. 
 According to the ceo of the merchant services that I use none of that applies to us because of them.  That's why I posted this so other vendors can reach out to me for information.   
 Oh very nice! Hope other reddit vendors hop on that train then. 
 So we actually accomplished something? 
 Let me know if you want any information.  We're with Best Rate merchant services and they specialize in the e  cigarette industry and that's why we're basically compliant, minus the $500 bs transaction fee. I can give you or anyone else my guys information.  He'll help you out and explain everything. Another juice company I know who uses them as well.  He actually contacted me earlier to tell me that they use Mastercard to purchase all their supplies  (about $250,000 per year)  and they are contacting them to let them know that they will no longer be using their services.   
 > He actually contacted me earlier to tell me that they use Mastercard to purchase all their supplies (about $250,000 per year) and they are contacting them to let them know that they will no longer be using their services. Everyone in the industry should do this today if they use BastardCard. 
 You go thru William? ? 
 We did it, reddit! 
 No one ever said it was going to be easy! 
 check out the coolfire iv. those mods are pretty idiot proof, and depending on which model you get they can chuck tits and run on internal battries. I would suggest the plus or tc100 model. as for tanks, I use the tfv8's. the baby beast and big baby would run really well on the coolfire iv tc100, not so much the plus as it only goes up to 70w. you wouldn't be able to use the cloud beast to its full capabilities though, as it runs a lot better over 100 watts. the coolfire iv tc 100 runs about 45-55 dollars online, and the baby beast is around 19 dollars, while the big baby is about 25. would link, but am on mobile.

 The cleaning service had a friend come over to your place? Did i understand that correctly? And that person stole your gear?  
 The cleaner person had a friend come over, and yes. 
 Yeah, shit people everywhere unfortunately. I'm surprised by the cleaner's reaction, see if they'll return it. 
 >this is my worst nightmare Your life must be pretty cool otherwise.  
 /r/legaladvice ? 
 If you can afford a cleaner, you can afford a new vape!! :) 
 First-world problems... 
 Deduct the price of an authentic stab wood mod and a $100+ atomizer as well. 
 a Friend While we're on the subject of friends.. my friend has red rash on his junk. Does anyone know a good cr�me to help with that? I'm asking for a friend. 
 I mix flavors in my all my tfv8s  (I have all 3) and haven't had a problem with mixing juices and my coils burning. Unless you're mixing menthol with a cinnamon flavor, most flavors mix really well together surprisingly.  When I want to put a new juice in my tanks I let it get down to about 1/3 of a tank and just add the new flavor. On a side note cinnamon churros and vanilla ice cream mixes really well with fruit loops. 
 Alright sounds good. Ya mustache milk and the local RiverSide eddy (lemon/strawberry/mellon) is really good, makes it taste like the fruit loops are back in the milk. 
 Look up vape socks.  
 Will it also keep my vapes from procreating? 
 Look up drip tip condoms 
 These are a must, bugs LOOOOVE getting stuck in there and being vaped. Jesus christ the horrors!  
 this is very true. 
 This is a real first world issue here! For real! I use those Oakley sunglass bags myself, but they don't work for big mods.. Now excuse me while I google vape socks... 
 Crown Royal bags. Does no one else use these things for everything?! 
 Blue 
 Shit, they all look bad ass. The red, green and blue are awesome though. Gun to my head, I'd go red. 
 No White plated. I'm triggered 
 Really depends on the mod but that rainbow one is wild 
 It reminds me or iridium  
 Yeah looks like an oil spill 
 I think they call that color aurora 
 Also known as neo chrome, oil slick, and chameleon. 
 Looks like a case hardened  
 I'm curious if every one looks different or if they're all the same 
 This guy plays csgo 
 This guy rushes FTFY 
 TFV8 Case Hardened 
 Not StatTrak best I can do is 3 keys 
 Gabe will not comply  
 blue!! 
 that red one is dope. 
 Rainbow looking good 
 Rainbow~ 
 The gold is dope. Picked that one up 
 I love the gun metal on my black H-priv mod. 
 Not normally a fan but that rainbow looks badass 
 Lol thanks a lot. I haven't wanted to buy more gear for a year...  
 Always been a fan of Stainless 
 Exactly. Stainless steel is the way to go. I take black when I have to but stainless is always my first choice. I've had a few atomizers that have visible paint chipped off. I could only imagine what could happen if that paint got into the rda/rdta/tanks. 
 Never smoked paint chips? 
 Depends on what mod it's going to top off but, I'm liking both the red and green ones.  
 Buy two and mix and match! 
 Blue definitely 
 blueeee 
 Green is sexy 
 I feel like I can justify every one of them but Rainbow and Gold stuck out first. 
 Red or blue! 
 I got the blue one last Friday exclusively for ronin tsunami :)  
 Green ez.  It will match the leds on my xcube  
 Really digging the blue one 
 Green and blue. 
 will the Rainbow be available for the Baby? 
 RAINBOW!!
 The rainbow one is majestic as fuck! 
 Does anyone know when the new colors go on sale? Also, should I wait until Black Friday to pick one up? 
 The rainbow looks pretty cool but that shade of blue is hard to beat.  
 That gun-metal tho... :breathing intensifies:
 blue and rainbow tbh
 Green looks great 
 Black 
 Personally I'd go for the gun metal, it's a nice middle ground between black and stainless  
 How does it perform? 
 Does it bug anyone else that the rainbow one is angled differently than all the others?
 I have the black. It's cool they are releasing all these new colors though. Choice is always good 
 Considering black matches everything (unless your mod is white) then id go with black. 
 Rainbow, because why not 
 I just see eight colorful leaks. 
 The green and blue are cool. Don't see that a lot. Stay away from chrome/silver, looks cheap.  
 My all time favorite cereal vape is [[Bedrock Shake]]. It's a mix of Fruity Pebbles and vanilla milkshake. For straight up Fruity Pebbles I think the most accurate is [[Fruity Pebbles by 123 Vapors]]. [[Bedrock by Vaporham Lincoln]] is sort of a cross between Trix and Fruity Pebbles, which is very good. It's dry cereal, no milk, if that matters at all to you. I think the most accurate Fruit Loops flavor is [[Fruit Troopers]], with [[Lightning Loops]] in a close second and [[Capone]] in a fairly close third. [[Why So Cereal?]] tastes, to me, like a mix of Trix and Fruit Loops [[Dragon Fruit Hoops]] is definitely a different take by adding dragonfruit to the recipe and it's pretty good. My favorite CT Crunch flavor is [[Cinnamon Toast Vape]], followed by [[CTC Cereal]] then [[Toasted by Om Vapors]].  [[Super Cereal]] tastes like Cap'n Crunch without the berries fresh from the mail, but after a steep tastes more like french toast. One of my favorites by VIAB. [[Cereal Crunch]] is a milk heavy version of Cap'n Crunch with Crunchberries. [[Retro Frankenstein]] is a fantastic replica of Frankenberry. 
 Clearly another cereal vaper, thanks for all the info. Time to do some cost research! 
 Pretty much. Cereals, creamy fruits, and creamy desserts are what I vape 80%+ of the time. 
 Since you seen familiar with them, how are the other cereal vapes from T1V? Could you also recommend some other creamy vapes that aren't cereal? I've been searching for an affordable creamy chocolate milk for ages with no luck. 
 Other than the flavors I listed and Big Bowl of Cereal, which was really good as well, I haven't had any of their other cereal flavors.  As far as creamy fruits go, from That 1 Vape I'd look at Strawberry Milkshake, Banana Pudding, and Apricot Custard... Of the flavors I haven't tried yet, I really want to try their Lemon Italian Ice, Mango Ice Cream, and Peach Yogurt. As far as creamy fruits from other vendors, honestly, the list would be too long to name, so maybe check [my JuiceDB profile](https://www.juicedb.com/user/kungfoogorilla/reviews) and see if anything I've revewed catches your eye.  
 Dude this is so detailed.  I only buy mind blowing melons by like the case from that 1 vape.  Is there a sample pack on a site?  Or just rattle off a few juice you think everyone  should try/have? 
 In addition to the three I listed I really liked [[Strawberry Shake by That 1 Vape]], [[Big Bowl of Cereal]], and [[Banana Pudding by That 1 Vape]]. And [[Pineapple Dragon]] is alright too. [[Sweetish Fish]] is probably my favorite Swedish Fish flavor. 
 Hmm is that 1 vape a really good vendor or could i do beter?  for price/quality? 
 T1V is a great vendor, *especially* for price/quality. I wouldn't say they are my favorite vendor, but they are certainly up there. They have 3 of my favorite cereal vapes I listed above. One of my favorite pure fruit vapes (Pineapple Dragon) and one of my favorite candy vapes (Sweetish Fish), though I'm not too big on pure fruit or candy vapes personally... the fact I actually like them even though they're out of my typical flavor profile says something.  
 Hmm interesting.  How long have you been vaping?  And how have you tried so much lol 
 Almost a year, I think. I've been able to afford trying so many flavors partly from giveaways here on Reddit, partly the awesome sales advertised here and JuiceDB, and partly because I use mostly budget vendors that I find on here and JuiceDB. Every holiday I use the sales megathread that's posted here, like the one coming up for Thanksgiving/Black Friday, as a way to try flavors I haven't tried before from a couple different vendors. 
 Capone from the Sauce LA. You can get 300ml for $27 shipped when their sale starts on Friday @ 40% off. That's like 10% of the price of Looper lol. If you like Fruit Loops you can't not like Capone. Haven't seen anyone not like it after trying it. 
 I second Capone. I really liked it.  
 I've read a lot of good stuff about this flavor, I'm just afraid to to pull the trigger. My biggest fear is that of all FL vapes- the taste of lemon Pledge. Any issues of that sort? 
 There is no lemon Pledge element to Capone. 
 I know what your talking about with the lemon pledge, definitely not the case with Capone. The lemon is less pronounced than most of the other fruit loops or pebbles juices I've had. This is definitely NOT a cheap tasting bargin juice like Fruit Hoops from Vape Wild (turned me off to cereal vapes for months). You can buy as small as a 30ml from them, maybe try that first with the 40% off sale? You just get stuck paying shipping for an order less than $25. 
 RemindMe! 3 Days 
  I can't vouch for their cereal but everything I've vaped from Humble has been quite good. A lot of the cheaper juices tend to be lacking in flavor, or at least that's how it seems to me, but Humble bucks that trend. Fruity Loops or whatever by G Vapers is decent, didn't knock my socks off but I'm not big on cereal.  
 Here in Russia (central Siberia) we are praising Humble liquids, because of their low price (compared to other American liquids) and beautiful taste. Big bottle of Humble (120 ml) costs 2000 rubles (around 30-32$), and you can easlily mix it with VG/PG base and get up to 200-300 ml of juice. It is so flavourful that when you mix it, the flavour stays. At the local vape bar we experimented with it, and mixed it in 1/10 proportion, and we could STILL taste the flavour.
 Centerfold vape co's Sammie is my favorite, but it's not super cheap ( much better than loopr though). Beyond that, the Sauce LA's Capone is a close second at a much lower price. 
 Predator.io Fruity cereal cupcake, fantastic flavor. It's called dawn. Let it steep for at least a week and MAN it really pops and is delicious. It's also easier on my coils then most other fruity cereal flavors. 
 Look up BigFinDeal, CRSP is $25 for 120ml. The best cereal you will ever have. 
 I've only tried 2 cereal flavors (still pretty new), Strait Jacket by VaporHQ and [[Divine Pebbles by Om Vapors]], both of which are quite good. Strait Jacket is milkier, and Divine Pebbles has more cereal grain taste. They're both a bit fruity and sweet. Strait Jacket is around $15/30mL, and Divine Pebbles is on sale for $12/120mL (yes, not a typo). 
 OM Vapors is another one of those cheaper companies. Any lemon Pledge issues? Also, one of the reasons I'm such a fan of Looper is the creaminess combined with the clear taste of FL. How is it in that regard? 
 It definitely tastes creamy to me. Not as creamy as the Strait Jacket, but then again, that one barely had anything other than milk and a bit of sweetness. I don't have a huge frame of reference on cereal flavors, though, so it's worth getting a second opinion. I'm vaping it at 25ish watts, too, so it's quite possible that it gets a lot stronger at high watts. I don't have a clean tank, or I'd try it out. The only flavor I've gotten lemon Pledge from is a strawberry limeade from a local shop here. It was the only juice I've had to dump out. 
 As far as affordable cereal ejuices go i personally really like [MtBakerVapor-Gimmix] (https://www.mtbakervapor.com/coupon-code-products/gimmix-e-liquid/). They're having a black friday sale.  
 You must have lots of friends around here. Every single post of yours gets instantly downvoted, doesn't matter the content lol. 
 Ahh wtvr. The amount of ppl that dm me on a daily basis thanking me makes up for it. *EDIT* Your comment does deserve an upvote though. 
 Raise your standards bro, that juice is garbage. Nice setup though ? 
 I guess it's personal preference but man I dig it. It's very good. But thank you! 
 I'm so confused by the atty. Is that a limitless plus with the RDA base? I don't understand the chuff cap, it doesn't match any of the limitless plus/classic/combo chuff caps! So many questions! 
 Looks a little like the limitless RDA, though I haven't built one in ages so I could be wrong.  
 No your right that's exactly what it is. I forgot all about that before the whole RDTA lines. 
 Mhmm, over priced and didn't really perform well in my opinion. How's the RDTA? Been tempted to pick one up but I'm concerned as I don't vape lung hits really.  
 I have both the limitless plus and the combo and I love them. But if your not a lung hit guy you will hate them, they are the most airy atty's I've ever been around heh. To me though I don't see the purpose of an RDA anymore with these, they are that good! 
 Nah I know that feeling. I quit dripping when I got my kayfun v4. Easy to build and amazing flavor. I'm not much of a lung hitter though so I'm sure I will hate them haha. Thanks for the heads up.  
 Puffin away on French Dude right now. I like it, but not sure if it will be a go to flavor for me. It's a little on the sweet side.  
 Yes it's a limitless RDA! I love it though it works very nice and it's super fun to build on.  
 Vapours tongue I'm guessing happened to me too but mine seemed to last longer than what everyone else was saying and still hasn't really came back flavour wise. 
 Seriously me lmfao
I'll change it when it's dry
*drips*
Oh yeah.. Next time.
*drips*
Damnit.. 
 The Cleito is good when it works but when it doesn't, it's a bloody disaster. Try changing the coil and try not to over prime it as it can/will create spit back and/or leak like a running tap. (When I had the Cleito, it was prone to vacuum locking and it'd leak like a fucker) 
 Well the coil I changed literally 2 days ago, that can't be the problem could it? Also any idea if the cleito 120 has the same problem?  
 It's honestly hard to say, it could be a dud coil (aspire are prone to them). I'm not sure about the 120, as I've never used one. 
 ah ok, the 0.4 coil was doing the same, that is why I changed it to the 0.2, so chances of 2 dud coils? 
 It is possible to have a whole pack of 5 being duds, but the odds of two different packs being all duds is unlikely. When you're vaping, do you carry on inhaling after or stop before the fire button is released? If you continue to inhale after you release the fire button it may help reduce the spit back.
 For maybe like half a second after it stops, when I look in the drip tip after vaping, it still has a bit of vapor 
 You can also take your coil, wrap it in paper towel, and blow through the top, like you're trying to shoot a spitball out of it. This will sometimes clear oversaturation. If that does clear it, try vaping with a more gentle drag.  
 Didn't seem to help :/ 
 Two, most customers tell me that they like the .4 coil better, you may try that.  
 Yea, speaking to a friend, he said the same thing (this was after the post) I'll try it when I get my hands on one, seem to be a bit rare here :/ 
 I'll try it when this tank is empty, thanks! 
 This also, OP. 
 If you try (gently) blowing the built up juice out, does it work well?  If so, might try to not leave vapor in the chamber after you puff - sometimes it can condense back to juice and drip in. 
 no liquid comes out when I blow, so I don't think the juice is condensing. 
 Their role is not to advocate for either side but to bring topics up for their audience to look into if they so choose.  Also there is no clear and unified medical opinion that they are safe. Some agencies say they are, others say they aren't. Anything we can say in the topic is anecdotal. Don't get me wrong, I'm 100% for e-cigs, but the data isn't all in our favor yet.  
 Friend of mine said the cool part about those is that they're touchscreen mods. The shit part is that they're touchscreen mods. 
 But. What is it? 
 Looks like a g-priv 
 Crooked ring 0/10 
 What mod is that? Ive seen a fee touchscreen mode, but not a smoke one. 
 Looks like a g-priv 
 I have to say, that's the nicest looking UI I've seen on a touchscreen mod so far 
 Smok G Priv? How is it? Almost pulled the trigger on one but went with an IPV 8 instead (Considerably cheaper..) 
 How much did this set up cost? I'll google the parts once we have validation from the OP of the parts; but if someone could give me a ball park figure it would be appreciated . 
 Around $110. It's a Smok G-Priv mod and a TFV8 tank I believe  
 Thank you kindly! I appreciate your time! 
 Oh man that IS nice!  Any issues with the screen? 
 Not at all! Works great.  
 I like mine, its a perfect setup for me  
 Where'd you buy that G Priv? I've been looking for one all over the place.  
 For those asking, it's the Smok G-Priv. http://www.smoktech.com/kit/g-priv 
 TFV8 tank by Smoke A.K.A the cloud beast. Is named appropriately. I picked up one today and my god even on half dead batteries limited to 80 watts the thing is absurd.   
 I'd have the LCD bleeding in like a week. My Cuboid's taken one hell of a beating, I'm convinced that thing would be toast quick in my hands. 
 Word 
 Crooked band and uneven wattage is bothering me lol  
 The fuck lol y tho 
 Thanks very much for sharing! Going to fill it after I finish with work. 
 The blue drip tip would really tie the room together 
 We have a lot of Chinese clones out there (I live in Russia), and they pretty much proved their worth. They are sertanly not as good as originals, but still good quality. 
 Narda is good, but with Hadaly rda clone available, is it still worth it?  
 Only one way to find out. You got a link to that thar Hadalay clone? 
 [Sure](https://www.fasttech.com/products/0/10028412/6228800-sxk-hadaly-styled-rda-rebuildable-dripping)
Although the guy needs to decide now, after a month (when you recieve it from ft) it will be too late I'm afraid. 
edit: at least 2$ better then the narda lol.  
 Oh, they almost the same, but Hadaly has better airflow and some other good options (pin and stuff). I think I'll buy a couple.  
 Aw shit. It comes with a BF pin, too? Now I need two.
Thanks for the hookup, friend. 
 Everyone seems to have a squonk these days, dammit. I guess it's time for me to also try it.  
 Kennedy 2 post. I bought one a while back and ended up with 2 more some how... 
 *Looks at posters name* *Hits Vape* *Coughs* Sanji is awesome. *Coughs* The troll v2 is what I use and with the right build and mod it's all around amazing and the price is great. 
 Got the nickname many years ago, due to almost exact same apperience as Sanji (missing curved eyebrows) =)
I heard about Troll (and 1 of my friends uses it), but I heard that it's not hte best RDA for flavour.
 
 I LOVE my goon and Kennedy, but avoid the copper as it will tarnish every few days and can really effect the flavor of your juice... of course, if you buy your friend a Kennedy, you are a hell of a friend!!! 
 We're mostly using clones here in Russia. But this clones almost exactly the same as originals (even considering materials). 
 Well, there are many authentics in Russia too. 
 I won't argue with this, but still, all of people I know mostly uses clones. It's much easier to obtain authentic mod or atty living in Moscow (since people has more money to spend on it). And I live Central Siberia. 
 I only had Kennedy (witch I passed to my gf) and recently bought x1 rda. the flavor on x1 seems to be better. I won't be buying anything for a while. Even tho I heard a lot of people that the recoil has great flavor too.  
 It does! I have one and it's great! 
 How're you liking the v3? I've heard mixed reviews! 
 I work night shift at an old folks home, and since everyone is asleep, I sit here and answers people's questions about vaping issues. Something about helping new vapers get through their issues makes me feel like i'm giving back to the community that's helped me so much 
 That's pretty cool, I work as a paramedic, sometimes I hang out with people that work at old folks homes in the middle of the night.  Y'all are great peoples... 
 we try our best, but man do the nights drag sometimes. I'm just glad I can use my laptop at work as long as i'm not neglecting my duty as a caretaker. 
 Are you a LPN?  Or non medical staff? 
 I'm a nurse aide, i do the grunt work 
 To be quite honest, you are the first person I go find to figure out if somebodies grandparents aren't acting right since you guys are with the residents all the time, you know when somebody isn't at their baseline... 
 I'm packing my bags with a buddy of mine.  We are leaving for the grand canyon tomorrow and checking all of our gear.  He's a bit nervous so he went out for some brewskies to get to sleep tonight... I'm vaping on Vape The Rainbow by Humble Co.   
 I just found Humble. Local shop sells it for $25 for 120ml. Can't get enough [[ Humble Crumble ]] honestly. Check out their website, doing a BOGO this week

^(To use, post a juice name like so: ``[[ Juice Name by Business Name ]]`` or ``[[ Juice Name ]]``) 
 Yeah for sure, their skittles juice is perfect, steeped real well too... 
 It's too sweet for me, but I'm about the earthy real flavors. Think I ran into too many low quality juices with sweeteners early in my vaping run. I ordered their Hop Scotch though from the site, really excited to try it. 
 One of the shop owners where we sell at introduced me to it, I figure that I would give it a spin and really like it.  I agree though it cant be an all day thing...  It definitely has a good price point and flavor profile... 
 Yeah the price point is key. I find myself cringing at $10-15 per 30ml nowadays which I was dropping all the time when I started. The fact it's 80/20 VG/PG ratio is even better. Then there's juices like Loopr from ANML that I love that are just sooooo expensive. I have to rationalize those. 
 I hear you...
You know, what I find is it's difficult to price things without racing to the bottom.  I really support local vape shops which create so much of the vaping culture and really serve as a gateway for so many people to this complex world.  If I run towards the bottom to try and make a quick buck, so do the rest of the prices and the entire community suffers. Also, why would a quality vape store want to buy from me whenever I undercut them online?  
What I think is going to happen, and where we are going will be providing more juice for a similar price point, like Humble.  We are just new and will grow in that direction.   I really support that concept because it creates more value for the consumer without destroying the market IMHO... 
 Yes! I support this concept for the market in general. Juice is plain overpriced, but it's also seriously competitive. Too easy to make to not have 1000 companies that can make exactly your product. I want to support local business. Every one of my vape advocacy has highlighted the local economy and the loss of jobs. Personally I try to buy all my equipment locally, and buy juice in between online orders.  
Most goods like this have some sort of baseline price. There's companies that charge a little more based on quality or brand and some that take advantage of the frugal buyer and offer a slightly lesser quality. What's a good standard to stick to? $25 per 100ml to keep it even?
I'm starting to get buzzed so apologies for the rambling 
 Well, On the production aspect of things, creating a large batch of steeped 100ml juice per bottle is an all day affair and especially if you don't dilute your flavoring gets expensive quick. But its worth it if a brand has customers that like the juice.  I find a comfortable line at 16.99 for a 30ml bottle of our product with shipping included which brings it down to about 14.00 just for the juice and about 2 dollars in shipping. Then discounts offered to specific communities that carry the culture bring it down even farther.  This allows me to go to local vape shops and promise them that I will never undercut their business and drive customers there.  Vape shops sell our juice for around 15 a bottle but people get it instantaneously.  What is great about selling in vape shops is the ability for a customer to try our juice which is always more convincing.  Literally everybody loves it.  I think online people fear, and rightly so, that the value that they get online won't be reflected in the juice.  We'll have giveaways and other things but really I think people go to shops speak to other people who essentially curate the experience for them.    I believe that this is why brick and mortar stores still exist so people can actually lay their hands on things and have human to human interaction.  
Honestly, I don't think that we will be successful through internet sales alone... what I really hope is that people take a chance and try the juice and then take it down to their vape shop and say I want that here and the eco-system is maintained...  
(edit)I also have had a few beers ;) 
 I respect that, especially if you're making it in smaller quantities. I took some time to look over your site and really like the sound of the HUN-EE and Deep Thought. Especially the HUN-EE. I'm vaping on a cactus fruit right now and it's WAY better than I thought it would be. It's your kind of juices that I *really* want to buy in a shop, but I have one hang up. I can burn 30ml of juice in a day. I'm running a TFv8 with the RBA right now, and it can CHUG juice. One of the biggest reasons I quit smoking was the money. The health implications definitely were a factor, but money out of my wallet was the biggest. I've never paid $16.99 for a pack of smokes which lasted me a day. That's the hardest part about buying in 30ml quantities. I want to try your juice, I'll be looking for a deal though for sure. 
 You know its funny, I was in a vape shop the other day and realized that its kind of like an art gallery/brewpub combined.. 
 First, hows it going everyone? Whats everyone vaping on? Ill be here all night since i have work i gotta get done. Tough day today but after tomorrow I'm on thanksgiving break.  
 Pretty great Monday.. No work, nice weather :)  [[ Princess by Blue Dot Vapors ]] tonight, a new one for me.

 Goood! Drinking before the Black Friday madness since I work retail. Vaping on [[ Empirical Prince ]] 
 I feel bad for you. Sounds good though!  
 Meh Im a manager of a cell phone store. We don't have to be open on Thanksgiving so actually I'm ok with it. Lots of money to be made and I'm taking an easy week leading into it.  
 As long as youre ok with it! I dont work in retail but i know lots of people who do and they are dreading it.

 I'll add it tomorrow, but it's a cactus fruit flavor. Super good. Mellow sweet and kind of earthy 
 Got some [[ jelly doughnut ]] at the moment. Nothing much here, still working but then again, I'm on the opposite time zone. 
Trying not to look/search into the black Friday sale thread... Must resist  
 Sounds good! Its technically the middle of the night but i get all of my work done at this time so its good! I have an exam tomorrow so im just studying. A shop near me is having crazy sales for black Friday (like 15$ for a limitless RDTA) so i might go there and take a look.  
 $15 for a Limitless is a good deal!  
 Yeah! Its like 50% off mods, attys and juice. So i have to take a look, im thinking of getting either an Alien or a VTC duel if they have them yet and a few limitless as gifts.

 Turbo roar by boosted and thrst, a tasty lemon custard/tart. Which reminds me if anyone has any citrus recommendations or custards/creams let me know! 
 Break starts for me tomorrow night too, thank the lord. Vaping the same old DIY nonsense I always do (alternating between good and hadaly).  
 Seems lonely in here. I'm vaping on a vanilla cake juice I mixed up the other day it's okish  
 It is lonely here... sounds pretty good!  
 Nothing much going on tonight. Just relaxing, watching Houston vs Oakland. Still vaping on Peanut Butter Crunch Skakes. Waiting on a Tesla Stealth to arrive in the mail. Hopefully it comes this week, probably have to wait 'til next week. 
How's everybody doing?  
 There has been movement on my Cthulhu MTL RTA and it was in the New York facility. Now it's in Connecticut. I'm in New Jersey. 
USPS is drunk as fuck apparently.  
 Aw snap! Made it just under the wire for the weekend insanity.
Had a package make it through Los Angeles customs today, another is still floating around in the Pacific Ocean somewhere, and another just leaving the Chinese warehouse. 
So... This is basically the future of vaping, I think...
Also, I totally had a Youde (UD) send me a Goblin Mini v3 overnight from China. Made it here in two day, via DHL. Shit was mind blowing. 
 And this is news to you? ;)
Sometimes I wonder how packages get to their destinations the way the USPS's logistics work! At least it's in the States, eh? 
 I literally get upset just *thinking* of going to the post office... 
 I live in a town that is mostly elderly. Going to the post office here is an exercise in defensive driving and tuning out stories of people's no-good grandkids or the damn neighbor's dog that keeps crapping in their yard. I'm amazed at how dolled up some of the regulars get before heading out for their errands and equally disgusted by their denture breath. That's one thing I miss about smoking sometimes-the dulled sense of smell can come in handy from time to time! 
 Sounds like Cocoon...  Whats funny is that I live in a state that has a rather elderly population but its in New England, so they have no fear of death... Grandpa's operating chainsaws, little old ladies walking across thick sheets of ice... Fist fights at the old folks homes... Tough breed this greatest generation ;) 
 With the new product lockout, what mods do you guys have your eyes on? What RDA's or tanks? I think Im set for mods atm with the Dripbox 160, Sigelei 213, and my trusty Cuboid. I am looking for a good bottom fed RDA though. The Nula just didn't cut it quality wise and I've heard mixed reviews on the Tsunami 24. 
 The Tsunami 24 or any 24mm will overhang a bit. But you can put the BF pin from the Tsunami 24 in the Tsunami 22, no overhang. 
 Just got a Dripbox 160 yesterday, myself. Currently using a Velocity v2 clone on it. It's *ok.* Going to build some bigger coils for it tomorrow and see how it works. Got an O-Atty in the mail and looking forward to pairing them up. 
 What's a good tank in the $25-50 range? I am currently using a Crown and it's not too bad, but looking to upgrade. Have a Sigelei 213W it will be going on. 
 Been hearing good things about the Cleito 120 tank. It's like $23-$30 right now, but I expect you'll see much cheaper this weekend. 
 Got a bit of a buzz, and am fighting the urge to order things online.
I did order some wire from fasttech (24-gauge kanthal and 34-gauge quad-twisted kanthal), but I'm going to need it. I have 7 different rtas/rdas coming in the mail (bless you, ecigclassifieds!), and I have no wire on hand. 
 I got a new winter coat and was flirting with my manager at the shop all day XD I might have problems XD still vaping on Heisenberg and will be foreverrrrr. We finally figured out our Black Friday sale! 
 Illum has the best prices on batterys normally but those are the same battery prices as brfore 
 Yeah sorry, we've been running that BF promotion for this entire month. Xtar discount is changed. 
 You can't beat the VP4 for $21.84, I just added six HG2's and got free shipping.
Thanks for the sale! 
 Indeed,  $21.84 for 4-bay charger that comes with both wall and car adapter is a steal. 
 Hi,
Do you ship international?  
 Yes we do. 
 Will any of these work with this? http://www.gearbest.com/temperature-control-mods/pp_447928.html?wid=21 
 Ya just get 2 [LG HG2's] (http://www.illumn.com/18650-lg-18650g2-3000mah-high-discharge-flat-top.html). Also you can get the [Smoant Battlestar 200w TC] (http://www.vapordna.com/Smoant-Battlestar-200W-TC-Box-Mod-p/smbtsr.htm?1=1&CartID=2) for $39 with coupon code VTRz7Zws5k from a US site so you dont have to wait for shipping (if ur in the US). If you're not in the US then order it from GearBest.  
 According to [this image from your link](http://des.gearbest.com/uploads/pdm-desc-pic/Electronic/image/2016/09/07/20160907150455_64916.jpg) it's a dual 18650 mod, so any of the flat top batteries posted above will fit.  I personally prefer the LG HG2's, been using Samsung 25R's for quite a while, but looking into picking up a pair of Sony VTC6's based on /u/Mooch315's recommendations recently. 
 Thank you for these great deals. Do any of the xtar charger have 1 amp charging on all four bays? 
 I believe the Dragon VP4 does which we unfortunately don't have in stock currently. 
 Just ordered from Illumn because of the recs from peeps on this subreddit, and couldn't be anymore pleased. Super quick shipping, everything authentic, great prices. I'll be getting more batteries soon for sure.  
 Well, there goes $50 lol. Luckily that's with confidence and this sale really helped for Xmas gifts. Thanks for the great prices as always!  
 Thanks for the heads-up on the sale. I had my eye on that Xtar Dual Bay last month, so I not only got to treat myself, but I found a nice stocking stuffer for the hubs too! 
 Lol just bought a set two weeks ago, then another set last week without knowing it was a black Friday sale. Quick shipping! ..that part may change when USPS gets busy though lol 
 How are the xstar products compared to nitecore? 
 I prefer X tar over Efest & Nitecore myself. 
 VTC5a for 6$?  Score! 
 Ugh just bought 4 new batteries. I'm always so busy preparing for our Black Friday stuff that I never think to do some shopping myself! 
 bought two VTC6 last time there was a sale:
It was shipped and showed up very quickly.
The batteries were not at a usable charged state and are legitimate VTC6's
They came in a clear plastic case. 
Would definitely, and do, recommend. 
 Is Sony making the 18650s again? 
 They never stopped 
 VaporBeast has the 200watt istick for like $28. 
[http://www.vaporbeast.com/eleaf-istick-200w-tc-box-mod.html](http://www.vaporbeast.com/eleaf-istick-200w-tc-box-mod.html) 
Think there's a Black Friday coupon out too. Do a search I'm sure you could find it.  
 Its actually $26.10 with coupon code yeahbaby but OP doesn't want a triple 18650 mod. 
 Smok alien. Nearly perfect 
 smok alien is what i would buy. Small dual 18650 that is in your price range. 
 Check out the [Smok Alien 220w TC] (http://www.vapordna.com/SMOKtech-Alien-220W-TC-Box-Mod-p/smalbm.htm?1=1&CartID=1) on sale for $40 with coupon code VTRz7Zws5k or the [Smoant Battlestar 200w TC] (http://www.vapordna.com/Smoant-Battlestar-200W-TC-Box-Mod-p/smbtsr.htm?1=1&CartID=2) on sale for $39 with the same coupon code. Both are great mods.  
 There's usually a smoking room option 
 It would suck if they fined you or kept your deposit. There's a massive difference in vape smoke and cigarette smoke. Tell them to go smell the room if they try anything like that. Also, wouldn't recommend vaping in it in the morning.   
 Good decision right? You should get a nice wide bore drip tip for it, it makes it so much better 
 22 or 24? How is it? I kinda feel like I need a black 24mm, on a skar, but I'm not sure. 
 [I have a black 22 which I have recently put on top of a lavabox DNA 75 (this is an old pic on my evic). I fucking love the thing. Amazing flavor and a breeze to build on once you get used to the clamp posts. ](http://i.imgur.com/VbxokxJ.jpg) 
 Just got the battery extender for my lavabox 200 today! I've been using that with my twisted messes squared (22mm) on it. I really like it, but I also really like the looks of the skar, and since it's big enough, think it'd look classy with a goon 24 on it. I also like the idea of having that much more room and capacity, but I worry about losing flavor too. 
 Yes, it's fine, as long as both liquids are intended for vaping (i.e. don't just mix with random stuff, like vanilla extract or whatever). 18mg + 0mg in equal amounts = 9mg. 
 There is nothing wrong with mixing two premade juices. sometimes I don't want to continue vaping a flavor instead of wasting juice, I get down to about half and add the other flavor I want to vape. sometimes you get interesting flavors out of mixing them.
the only problem would be mixing your juice with things that aren't meant to be vaped i.e. water, food extracts, essential oils.
might it taste weird? yeah, will it kill you? no. so go ahead and mix those two juices together. 
 Mixing different flavours probably would be not the best idea. Even changing liquid without cleaning the tank sometimes creates strange flavour combinations. Mixing with flavourless base liquid is safe. (Base liquids are PV/VG/Nicotine mixes intended for DIY). 
 I mix flavours all the time. Can never find a flavour that I like on its own. But I have found a few mixtures that tastes great 
 there is nothing wrong with mixing two premade liquids together. 
 Nope; I do it all the time, as long as the two flavors match. For example Mad Hatter's I love cookies mixes really well with Humble Juice Co Humble Crumble. 
A flavor like cherry will mix really well with a tiny bit of creamy lemon and raspberry. That way you get a rocket pop ice cream flavor.  
 Tobacco flavours I find mix great with a double some sisha.  
 Sometimes I just like to throw stuff together, who would have thought cinnamon churros with vanilla ice cream would taste good mixed with fruit loops? 
 Are you using juice full of sweetener? Priming the coil correctly? 
I haven't used the q4 but I just changed my t8 coil after nearly 4000 puffs.  
 How do I know if my juice contains sweetener? Definitely priming properly. 
I'll probably try the T8 coil if nothing else can fix it.  
 Is it a store bought premium juice. If so you can bet your bottom dollar it's likely to be loaded up with sweeteners which will gunk your coils.
I make my own juice and there is one recipe I've used on the t8 coil which did shorten the life of it dramatically. The juice is one of the only ones I use which I load up with sweeteners.  
 It is store bought and its from a local manufacturer. Is this whole sweeteners burn juice faster theory confirmed? I'm not going to start making my own juice that's for sure. How do I know what's in my juice? 
 It's not really a theory. Sugars and artificial sweeteners harden and caramelize with heat. That gunk sits on your coil when it burns.  
 [This](http://i.imgur.com/KJt8nAG.jpg). Yes, that is shoelace.

 Damn, you beat me to it. 
 whoever did this needs to go get screened i think 
 There's a video on here somewhere of a drunk guy making a vape with car audio wire, cotton from qtips and a car battery. I don't know what is worse.  
 I used to use blue fish tank filter in my 510 cartos. Actually I probably still have some laying around. 
Damn we have come a long way since 2006/2007.  
 I just threw away a bunch of blue filter cartos from 2009 
 Was looking for this comment. 
 Not so much wicking in any way but does anyone remember the guy who used lead as a coil? 
 RIP in peace 
 Yup

 wow that dudes karma is still negative from those posts 
 I'm sure I read about folks using tampon cotton although I'm not sure if it was entirely serious 
 They're a big ball of clean cotton and/or rayon, I can't see why they wouldn't work in a pinch. I know from experience they work great to repack a Zippo. 
 I wonder how well that would work. I mean, it has to be absorbent, and it has to be safe for long-term fluid contact with the body. 
 Works nicely, that's mostly all I get my rayon from for the last year. 
 Yeah I've used it in a pinch before I started ordering giant quantities of organic squares 
 Actually tampon material is sterile and has multitude of uses. 
You can use is as a material to start fire - it very flammable.
You can use it as a water filter - it does it really well.
You can use tampons to stuff bullet holes to stall bleeing before getting the person to the hospital. 
>You can use tampons to stuff bullet holes to stall bleeing before getting the person to the hospital.
That's actually what tampons were originally used for. Then nurses were all wait, I've got a bleeding hole too 
 Very clean and pure cotton, comprised of very long fibers as well. there's weirdly zero problems with this approach ? 
 I agree, tampons have to be made of high(ish) quality cotton because they are used in an area of very sensitive tissue. 
Using a cigarette filters cotton, now that would be bad. 
 A lot of them are made of mostly Rayon now, actually. But yeah, can't see it being any worse than cotton or Rayon. 
 I used an actual strip of an old cotton tshirt once.
It... worked... until I found out the hard way the shirt was NOT cotton.

 TBH, everytime I'm in Hobby Lobby's yarn aisle with my fiancee, I'm thinking, 'I wonder if anything in here could be used for wick material?' 
 Back in like 2006 when we were jigging up flashlights and Altoid tins, we used pure cotton strips. It turns out, those are treated to patch clothes. It wicked really well, but my god were they disgusting. 
 Quartz 
 Quartz is still used commonly in other types of atomizers, of the tree variety. Works well for that but cant imagine it would be any good for ejuice. 
 Oh dear, I remember when it was a craze and everyone was wrapping coils around quartz rods. A week later, it's like uhhhh yeah probably not working as well as we hoped. 
 I dont see how it was ever used for ejuice...it doesnt obsorb anything. I have a wax atomizer i use on my alien, it works great for that, but really all the quartz is doing is keeping the shape of the coil and dispersing the heat evenly. Not sure how it was ever intended to be a wick for juices heh. 
 Yeah I've rebuilt a few w9tech carts and it either uses quartz or like a black ceramic. ***Idontfuckinknow*** 
 They work great for shatter/bho but not good for juice I would imagine. I got into vaping from concentrate vaping so I'm new to ejuice but know coils and rebuilds from wax.  
 From what I remember, it was like a drip onto the quartz and vape thing. But from common sense, it's like you have 2 seconds to shove that shit in your mouth and hit the fire button before all the juice drips off into the juice well? How to work??! 
 Especially with high pg juice which most juice was back then. 
 capillary action.  
 Silica wicks worked well, until you got a dry hit, and no one could tell you why (I'm talking about the early early EARLY days of vaping, where shops opened up and the ones around here had no idea what they were doing). It was basically buy a new clearo/carto when this happened. Then the shop near me realized one day I can buy a new base/coil for THREE WHOLE DOLLARS less. Fun times. The AeroTank was amazing when I first got it. 
Oh yeah, some high schooler thought it would be funny to stuff pubes in his protank coil.  
 >Silica wicks worked well, 
Until you get [silicosis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silicosis)... same thing that can happen with ceramic. *cringe* 
 There are THC cartridges that use those old ass clearomizers with the silica wicks. The worst part about those is that you have no idea if you're getting a dry hit because it's just harsh as fuck no matter how you vape it. 
 Damn really? Sounds horrible lmao. A dry hit on those was like tasting the devils swamp ass. And new vapers think THEY'VE tasted hell, psh. 
 Yep! Like the THC oil (I think it's an oil) is harsh and when it dry hits, it feels just a little harsher so it's hard to tell when it's just warmed up or dry hitting. 
 Thinking about it now, I'd imagine it would hurt. I've bought wax a few time and nothing competes with the harshness of that.  
 Especially the BHO or butane hash oil. The supercritical C0� extracted oil is far less harsh but more potent in my shitty opinion. 
 Try out live resin if you're into concentrates. Vapes smooth and arguably the most tasty way to consume THC. If you don't have a vape for it, you can always torch the shit out of it in a bowl. 
 Yes haha, sorry I'm in Texas. We call that wax or shatter. 
My friend bought a vape specifically for it and it was as you described, tastes great but very smooth.
I got myself a pipe and wand. Man, I've never had THC taste so good, it was amazing. But it felt like inhaling glass. I would cough for a minute straight if I took too big of one. 
Hell, same friend moved to CO for University. He had to give them up because shatter kept giving him bronchitis lmao. 
 Not to be one of those douchey-tree-people from WA, but the distinction between live resin and wax/shatter is this:
Live resin is produced from an extraction of fresh, _frozen,_ plant material, wax/shatter is from dried, normal plant material. Live resin allows for unbelievable flavor and terpene profiles to shine through, much more so. 
 /u/BigOhmTitties what this guy said! Very similar product, but different way of processing it. 
 Impurities in a very sub-par (read _shitty_) concentrate was what in fact was causing him to be susceptible to bronchitis repeatedly. 
 Disclaimer: this is a very bad idea for reasons which will be explained.
I played around with carbon fibre once, with the idea of using it as both wick and heating element (it conducts electricity). Used a Protank head with a bundle of carbon fibre making two negative connections at the juice holes, held together in the middle with a bit of kanthal for the positive connection.
I never tried to inhale the vapour because of the problems described below but it did produce a lovely dollop of smooth vapour, kind of like a ghost easing itself out of the chimney. I'd like to try something similar with multiple strands of very thin wire but you'd need a metal/other suitable material with very high resistance to make anything usable. 
The problems are:
1. Negative TCR. The resistance of CF drops when heated so, unlike the metals we use for temp control, if you use it on a normal mod it'll draw more and more current as it heats up. Dangerous without equipment to monitor the changing resistance and ensure the batteries don't get overloaded. I was using it on an OKR-T/10 which gave me enough clues about what was going on not to continue experimenting.
2. Nasty resins used to bind the fibres. Heating to white hot for an extended period might or might not be enough to get rid of the nasties.
3. Inhaling fibres (risk of silicosis). I don't know how big a risk this is in a wet environment, and it's no different to the risk of using silica for wick which used to be standard. Occupational guidelines for working with CF seem to recommend little more than keeping the work area wet so not clear how much it matters for vaping but dry hits might be risky. 
 Wire mesh, blue foam, tea bags.. Basically anything that would absorb anything lol 
 This is an OG forum thread for you (pyramid tea bags, Walmart batting, fish filters...)  
https://www.e-cigarette-forum.com/forum/index.php?threads/18255/  
I did the pyramid tea bags. They worked surprisingly well.  
 I remember those pyramid tea bags, they were game-changing upgrades at the time.  
 I've used medical gauze while at a friends after I burnt the shit outta my cotton. Tasted kinda weird, worked. Replaced it once I got home.

 Let us know what part of town you'll be in, that'll do a lot to help. 
That being said I'm from the North part of Houston, Woodlands area, and H-Town Vape is one of the better stores in my opinion. Also check out Vapor Trend or Civil Vapes. 
 I'm actually going to be close to The Woodlands! Thank You Very Much! 
 Thank you for the review and glad you were taken care of! 
 Great review  
 Awesome review! Congrats 
 Sure I'll try them out if they send me free ejuice too.  LOL 
 Nice! A coworker of mine had the iPower... for a week. He lost it somewhere at some bar when he and his buds went drinking. Fucking idiot.
I was quite impressed with it. A great quality, low power mod with a huge built in battery. If I was to go for something like that, this would be it! Hope you enjoy it. 
 Yeah so far its great. no issues at all and it feels great in the hand with its material and weight. 
 How did you do the custom logo? 
 Why not just buy the best mod you can afford and put a Jwrap on it? 
 I'd rather it be naturally green, but that could do. Truth be told I'm super new to vaping in general and didn't realize this was a thing. Are they easy to apply? 
 Pretty straightforward, yeah. I'm a klutz, and I can still manage it. 
 God I'd kill for a Smok Alien in Black/green, green is also my favorite color.
There's not really many green mods, best way is to get a wrap from somewhere.  
 I know, right? I wish green was a more widely available color for mods out of the box. Does no one like the color or something? 
 Even in computers, it's all red/blue , bleh.
Had to go out of my way to get my computer green :(

 These look so cool. 
 Why green?

 Pricey, but if you can track down a tuglyfe dna200, the black and green splatter is sexy as all hell 
 Can u send me the link to where you found that ? I want to look into it more  
 Loooks like we made it !  
 Not so fast... Haven't heard anything about this and it was supposed to be withdrawn effective 5 days ago? I'd hold off on spreading word the FDA backed off, doesn't seem like something they'd do so soon. 
 Interested in this. Commenting to follow only. 
 Commenting for a source. This is too good to be true coming from the shit type FDA 
 Electrical tape over the positive end of the battery.
A small cardboard box, like what batteries come in.
Ziplock bags (individually)
Anything to avoid anything touching the battery, hell wrap it in cling wrap 
 This is exactly what i do. Just wrap the battery length-wise with electrical tape. 
 Weird I've always had my batteries in my mod but kept the device completely off. Never had a problem going through TSA. Is this a recent change or your airport being picky now?  
 I would get a tfv8 over a tfv4 as they had a big leaking issue and the h-priv has a thing with getting juice under the screen that could cause it to short. I was gonna get an h-priv kit, but I ended up getting the alien kit after doing research on everything.
I wish I could give you mod recommendations but I have an alien and have little experience with other mods. if you want an h-priv, smok is coming out with the hpriv pro kit that comes with a tfv8 baby beast  
 You're right! If it comes out in the next few days I'll pick it up for sure! Thank you.  
 I am using the Wismec RX200s with the FreeMax Scylla tank
its amazing and my coils are lasting about 3 weeks so far
Defiantly recommend checking it out!
click ship vape   
 Have a Tfv8 and have had many other tanks, but none have really compared for cloud production. I prefer an Rda most of the time, but if I need to use a tank for any reason, the only one I use is the tfv8. If I was going to buy anything right now it would be the Cleito 120 though. The first gen is great for flavor, but needed to be bigger, and that's exactly what the Cleito 120 is. Check it out, all sorts of good reviews.  
 Samsung 30Q are a good alternative, since the LG HG2 get faked *a lot*. But as long as you buy from a trusted source (such as ilumn) you're fine with buying LG HG2 again. 
 whats a trusted source? I bought from wakeandvape.com last time. Are the 30Q cheaper and better?
 The differences between the Samsung 30Q and the LG HG2 are really minor. When you measure it i think the 30Q lasts a bit longer while the HG2 keeps the voltage a bit higher overall. Nothing you should notice while vaping it :)  
here is a an overview over good batteries and trusted vendors: https://www.e-cigarette-forum.com/forum/attachments/image-jpeg.600623/#subs  
Please, please dont buy batteries from ebay or amazon. 
 I just bought 4 more of the same LG batteries from :https://www.illumn.com hopefully they are good?
 Yeah, ilumn is fine as well as the LG HG2 :) 
 My Samsung 30 Q's came on Saturday. Ordered from imrbatterries.com. they ship them with battery cases and stickers. You can also pick up wraps or chargers if need be. 
 price and source? That website leads no where
 Sorry, typo.
https://www.imrbatteries.com
It's actually cheaper then what I paid last week. 
 You can get 4 [LG HG2's] (http://www.illumn.com/18650-lg-18650g2-3000mah-high-discharge-flat-top.html) for $20 from illumn. Theyre still the best. That or Samsung 30q's. 
 oh really great thanks for the link and being understanding someone else mentioned 30q's can you elaborate if it doesnt take too much of your time
 The LG HG2 is still the king, in my opinion.  
 That's Kanthal. Not a TC wire.
 Says [Nikrothal 80](http://www.kanthal.com/en/products/material-datasheets/strip/nikrothal-80/) on the package. 
[This](http://image.dhgate.com/0x0/f2/albu/g1/M01/2A/FB/rBVaGVZG2beATqg5AAHw3sS26-Y571.jpg) is exactly what i picked up at my local vape shop, but in 22ga.
I did get those two numbers mixed up when i wrote it up.
Good eye. 
 Go pick up some SS316L wire, best bet as a beginner for TC. You got yourself some non-tc wire there bubs. 
 Its all they had when i went in so i picked it up because i was excited to use the new mod that just arrived, Ive yet to touch TC.
i got two more coming in this week,
this [clapton](https://www.fasttech.com/p/4462706) wire coming in, (its not actually alien)
with some plain ol kanthal 26ga.  
 Lightning Vapes has some nice 26/36 SS316 clapton wire.
https://www.lightningvapes.com/collections/specialty-wire/products/clapton-wire?variant=18320468933 
 Unfortunately that clapton wire is also a kanthal that you won't be able to TC on.
TC is interesting to play with and some people prefer it, but most of us find it fairly gimmicky. Don't feel like your missing out on too much until you pick some TC wire up. It's not like it's going to blow your socks off. Biggest benefit I have found is battery life savings more than anything else. More of a consistent vape? Sure maybe a little, but it's not life changing. 
 I had a lot of problems with my rx2/3...It could be that the 510 pin inside the mod is pushed down. Try ***GENTLY*** prying it up with something thin and report back 
 Just tried with a paperclip...not sure if I even moved it, the space that I need to put it in is so small I cant get any leverage in. 
 Very very slightly bend the tip of the clip?  
 Managed to get some good prying in there, but again not sure if it moved. Maybe I pushed it down even further when I was trying to clean it?
Can I put something conductive between the pins? 
 Try using them needle nose ceramic tweezers if ya got any. My sister had the same problem with her rx200. Mine does it to sometimes but it never permanently stays that way  
 try updating the firmware or reflash it with the same firmware 
 Custom finish as in sanded the hell out of it?
How's the vape on it? I'mabout to buy it and I can't seem to find a lot of info about it...
Does the button get really hot on that smpl? 
 As in got drunk dropped the black one sanded the shit out of it now it's silver, and nahh mine doesn't get hot like at all. 
 I'd probably use high-strength isopropyl alcohol and some q-tips. 
 Rinse the tank with pure isopropyl alcohol and let it evaporate (don't like this method very much) or use an ultrasonic cleaner.
Or get a tank that you could actually disassemble and clean..  
 sub ohm tanks get hot, especially when chain vaping. it's just the nature of the beast. try getting a different drip tip to help with the heat, or vape at a lower wattage. you could also get an RDA or RDTA to build coils for use in temp control mode, or get a tank that uses SS coils for temp mode as the SS coils for the crown are made of two different metals. 
 Thanks for your reply! As long as its not hardware/user error I'm happy. I've been thinking about learning how to do RDAs but the crown is so smooth and pretty I'll have to get a glass tip instead. 
 I would try to find delrin, it's one of the best at heat dissipation. it may not look as nice though
 Find a copper tip for it. It will have to have a cone shaped bottom. Mine was 100% better after I got rid of the stainless tip.  
 It's a wholesaler, you might not be able to open an account without showing business credentials. 
 They are a regular site that sells to the public.

 Dude, read your own link!
[Here] (https://www.reddit.com/r/electronic_cigarette/comments/5b6bte/giveaway_new_eleaf_icare_mini_and_mrsalte/) is a giveaway they just had. 
 VG/PG ratios the same? 
 You can try putting in some rice and see if that dries it out and fixes it? If not I would buy a new one, they aren't that expensive. The tank is fine just dry it out. Buy a new battery and mod for like 40 bucks. 
 Only additional note is STOP FIRING IT. The battery could be compromised if it is compromised it could vent (explode and release nasty gasses) unlike a phone battery vape batteries carry a lot more power! Stay safe!  
 So when my boyfriend gets home from work in a couple hours, after its been sitting in rice for awhile, should I tell him not to fire it? 
 You should tell him you dropped it in the tub. :|  
 I would defiantly not fire it for at least over night. After that fire it with the knowledge that if the thing starts hissing you have a safe place to chuck it and it can explode without causing damage. 
 I wouldn't let it dry out over night 
 You mean you would, right? 
 I'd look at one of the Provari 2.5s http://www.provape.com/ProVari-153-Mini-Variable-Voltage-E-cig-s/38.htm  Dirt cheap fairly good charge replaceable batteies  
 Eleaf Aster?
http://www.myvaporstore.com/Eleaf-Aster-TC-Mod-p/elis-is7600.htm 
 My guess is that it's still too boxy for him. Gotta work with those skinny jeans, you know? 
 Damn. He's going to have a hell of a hard time finding much smaller than that. I mean, he could get a Dicodes, but that's like $300-$400 range. 
 Juul, Icare, Myjet, Von Erl... considered that type of thing? 
 Nah, he's definitely ready for a step up from that kind of thing, and he's got enough juice around that a Juul wouldn't make sense. Thanks tho. 
 Like a regulated tube mod? 
 Lol I think so. 
(Is it obvious I don't know much about this stuff?)
Right now I'm looking at the [Ego One XL](https://www.vapes.com/collections/ecigs/products/joyetech-ego-one-xl-starter-kit-vape-pen-for-e-liquids-2200mah) and it seems pretty solid. I'm also considering a Kanger SUBVOD Mega TC, but that might be a little advanced for him? 
 Wismec Vicino comes to mind, it's the only tube-shaped regulated that i know of. 
 What about a Kanger Subvod?  40w, internal battery, USB charging, uses the Toptank Nano and standard (0.5, 1.2 etc) Kanger Coils. 
 Cigalike: plenty of pod systems like juul.
Otherwise you could do the Ijust kit, it's a tube mod with tank.
Or if he is willing, grab a istick pico kit. 
 ANML Looper?
Whit E Octopus? 
 > Whit E Octopus
Nope, does not look the same. it was a thin 10ml bottle, purple liquid. berry flavored 
 Sounds like ANML Looper. Was it a fruit loops flavor? 
 > ANML Looper
No, it was berry flavored and a purple color. I googled ANML Looper and it does not look the same, but since 2 people have mentioned it, is it any good? 
 Per your edit, you might like Looper, ANML and Gemini have the same bloke behind both.  
 It is. Costs a bloody fortune though. Might be worth investigating when the multi-vendors (breazy, vapecentric etc) drop their BF sales. 
 [[Capone]] is the everyman's Looper. 95% as good, at 15% of the price.

^(To use, post a juice name like so: ``[[ Juice Name by Business Name ]]`` or ``[[ Juice Name ]]``) 
 Octo from Gemini, good stuff. I picked it up the first time since I liked the bottle 
 The Nautilus is a solid performer, but I'd suggest getting the 1.8 ohm Triton Mini (not Triton) Clapton coils for it, not the OG Nautilus coils.  *Much* better QC, solid performers. 
 Try what I do. I was getting what tasted like burnt all the time. I changed the way I inhale. I'll inhale while holding the button for three to four seconds, release the button, but continue to inhale for however long I wanted. Started using less juice, less coils and best of all no more burnt taste. Noone helped me with this therefore I just assume everyone is inhaling this way, but don't know how to explain it 
 Use higher watts take smaller pulls maybe force yourself to use temp control, that burning is releasing extra toxins. 
 You're not really going to have enough power for the Cleito 120 or the TFV8, but you could easily get away with the original Cleito or the Baby Beast. 
 I can get the Baby Beast, seems to have a decent price tag. Is it going to perform like the full TFV8? (Or, decently on my mod? Better than the iSub V?) 
 It's not quite TFV8 territory, but it has much better flavor. Certainly a big step up from what you're used to. 
 and it will have better cloud production than the iSub V? 
 Much. 
 Great, I think I'll get it then. Thanks so much for your help man! <3 
 i have the coolfire tc100 and love it. it was my first non ego/pen type mod. i use the avacado and order premade coils for it. the wicking is a little challenging to get perfect but when you do... oh man is it a nice vape. for another beginner like myself, id recomment the avacado and another non bottom airflow RDA. im currently using the hastur v2 rda and i LOVE it. the build space is quite small but the flavor is great and the look of this thing is cool. also would recommend the royal hunter RDA. i wouldnt recomment bottom airflow as i have never had one that didnt leak if you put more than 3 drops of juice. and yes it CAN fire down to .1 ohms. lowest ive gotten it was .19 i usually stay around .3-.6 ohms. if you have any questions about the mod feel free to ask. ive been using it every day for the last two months. 
 also. this is what you have to look forward to when you start building on RDAs. this is a twisted 26g build i did. ohms out to about .25 and i vape it at 100w
https://www.instagram.com/p/BNDaslpj0x4/?taken-by=jak0e 
 Yeah, you could do. TBH as long as you've got aircon and indoors is in the mid-20s centigrade it shouldn't be an issue. I never had any problems with juice spoiling in Miami. 
 The Sun is your worst enemy. That said, if you can work out some closed cabin or drawer, it should be cold enough as long as its not hit by direct sunlight. 
 I have a little bit of space in the beer fridge (on one of the shelves that doesn't fit beer) where I keep all my juice. Got juice in there that is over a year old and looks and vapes exactly the same as when I bought it. 
 keep as much as possible in the refrigerator. A little heat can add some steep, but it all depends on the juice. I've had some juice roast in my car in the sun and taste delicious and others that were wrecked.  
 I keep mine in the bathroom cupboards. Everything in one lockable box. Seems to be fine. Don't have A/C at home too. 
 Digivape Pharaoh
Aeronaut 24mm
Prophet 24mm 
 How thick of coils can you get on the Aeronaut? I'm a little concerned that the connection might not fit a thicker coil lead 
 I have a 3x26gx38g alien in it right now and I think I could fit a thicker wire easily 
 How much does that thing need to fire up? Damn!  
 Thank you, looks like the RDA for me 
 Haha, that was quick. Thank you, from what I've seen and our past talking, you're a reliable redditor 
 I was going to recommend the Pharaoh and Aeronaut, but was beat to it! 
 Quick responses, wow. I've seen a few of your posts too, you seem like you help out a lot 
 I always try! The Aeronaut is a pretty unique piece. I think it'd be exactly what you're looking for. Better than the Pharaoh IMO.  
 Yeah? I'm torn between the two right now. I'm a little worried that the Aeronaut might not have big enough post holes (or really just the area where the screw holds the lead in this case). I sometimes just toy around with wire, and some things I make can be really thick (twisted clapton'd with twisted one time). Also, what would you say makes the Aeronaut better? 
 I HATED the airflow only being on 1 side of the Pharaoh. Also, it gets messy pretty quick. It builds up condensation inside real quick. With the well on the Aeronaut, your basically getting the same capacity. The airflow customization on the Aeronaut is also way cool. I think both are pretty poor as far as aesthetics, but function: my vote goes to the Aeronaut.  
 Alright, I'll look into it and see what other people suggest as well, but as long as it looks like I can get large coils in and others don't have something to say, I'll probably end up getting the Aeronaut, thank you! 
 I think you'll be fine with the deck. It's a clamp deck, kinda like the Goon.  
 OHHH the first picture I looked at that showed the deck was top down and not the clearest picture, so it looked like when the deck is like a squared off letter U and the screw goes down and traps the lead. Clamp would be amazing, I was basically looking for a single coil Goon, posts on opposite sides, I think this would fit the bill perfectly 
 Another vote for the Pharaoh. I use volcano wire 3.5mm in it with no space issues.  
 try Psyclone Hadaly 
 High grit- 2000+. I use 2000 up to 7000 then polish for a mirror finish. 
Pick up an ego-510 adapter and you will be able to clamp it in a drill for easy sanding.  
 That's great, thank you 
 Some of those dings look a little deeper. I would start with 1000 grit and wet sand it. Get a spray bottle and wet rated sandpaper. The water keeps the material you sand off from acting as friction and causing deeper scratches. Work your way to finer paper until you reach the shine you want 
 Shall do. Thanks! 
 (edit : just realized belt sander is actually a stupid idea but I did it before...) Obviously you could pay someone to do it for you but it might not be worth it since it's a clone. I suggest you just buy sandpapers with varying grits like /u/JarlFirestarter0 said and do it with a drill but DON'T jump grits because doing that won't get the scratches out and it will look ugly and half-assed in the end. Best of luck to you! :D 
 A belt sander the best for a tubular object? 
Sorry but I have to disagree. If you're going to suggest tools the normal person doesn't have,  A lathe is going to be the best for a tubular anything. 
Chuck it up and sand it spinning, way quicker and less dangerous than trying to sand round things against a flat belt sander.  
 Hmm, I did use a belt sander on a tube before but now that you said it, I just realized how stupid that was lmao... I'm such an airhead :( 
 Hey, check this out:
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIt7TI5Ld1k
I think he does exactly what you are wanting to do 
 You really shouldn't. We don't know all the health effects of vaping, it's too new. Certainly it is safer than cigarettes, but safer, and healthy are two separate things. Putting anything into your lungs isn't the greatest idea in the world.
Take up gum, toothpicks, chasing poon etc... vaping really should be a smoking cessation tool and not a hobby. 
 That's a good point, that's been the main reason I haven't, is because I'm worried that I'll start and then it'll be discovered that it's horrible for you 
 if it relieves the stress then that could be a net gain, but there are also healthier things to do when stressed. exercise and/or meditation being two things I do that are very helpful for stress! 
 Smoking nothing is better than smoking something. I wouldn't start vaping if you've never smoked, especially since there are healthier alternatives to relieve stress.  
 Don't do it, not worth it. You seem like a smart guy judging by your WRX comment lol. 
 I just say fuck the stereotypes and vape proudly. (just don't be a vapehole and no one really care lol)
I got my friend one as a stress relief thing and to stop him from boredom eating and he vapes 0 nic juice. it's helped him out a lot with his anger issues because whenever he gets mad he just blows clouds.
STAY AWAY FROM NICOTINE THOUGH. even if it's free juice or whatever. just don't use it. if you haven't used it just stay away from it, it'll just become an addiction for you
as much as it is a cessation device for smokers, and most people on this sub are hardcore against people vaping who never smoked, it's your body and ultimately your choice. just do your research 
 Yeah, I find myself boredom eating a lot, and even though I'm skinny, it's still not a good habit. I would plan on never using nicotine because, like you said, I wouldn't want to be addicted to it. 
 just remember, everything gives you cancer according to the internet, so vaping is just gonna give you super cancer /s 
 There is hidden fat, it's potentially more dangerous than obesity because you can't really see it and know something is wrong until after something bad happens.
I bet you already know, but being skinny is not an indication of being healthy. Boredome eating isn't good, like you already know, even if you don't gain weight from it. The hidden fat doesn't add much to your weight or form but it comes with all the risks that obesity have.
If vaping 0nic will help you stop boredome eating and help with stress, which also is bad, then the unknown risks *might* be worth it. That's up for you to decide.
The best you can do to stop boredome eating, hidden fat and stress is exercising and eating properly.
With that said though, I'm not exactly healthy myself. It's easy to tell others what to do but actually doing it is another story. I probably have skinny fat problems but I just can't be arsed to exercise and I love my midnight snacks. 
 Yeah, that's why I do it, it's a nice change of pace. If you can do 0 nic too, why the hell not, personally I stick with 3 as I like the bit of stimuli.
BTW do you have subs and a system in the wrx? if so you need to learn tricks and rock a flatbill as well. 
 I have nothing done to the wrx in terms of audio. I've got upgraded brakes, lowered a little, Cobb accessport, and that's it lol. Also I have no idea what a flat bill is 
 its a baseball cap, but instead of the bill of the hat being rolled up to be useful and block the sun, its completely flat and useless for anything other than making you look like an incredible douche. 
 Ooooh, a snapback lol 
 The flatness helps you chuck, bro. Your clouds bounce off it and expand in all directions. How else am I gonna blow my jelly shark squids bro? Clouds bro, clouds. 
 This is next level... i think. 
 You buy a new mod. 
 Keep your fucking snarky comments out of my posts,k , K. 
 Haven't you ever heard of fasttech? Just order from there and itll clear customs. They write pliers or some shit on the package.  
 > dogetank
fasttech and other popular sites are totally banned man, they have rights to rip off packages for real.  
We have a dictatorship right now. 
For real. 
 Nope. We still have to R&R coils and wicks. I'm sure the day will come though. 
 We have to rest and recuperation ?  wicks and coils?
Is there a new definition of R&R I dont know? 
 May I ask what country? 
 Erdoganland 
 I know there is one atty out there that uses a Chip coil that supposedly lasts like 6+ months, it does need rewicked though. I can't for the life of me think of the name.
Still think you'd be better off with an RTA and some cheap wire and cotton from like Amazon if they are seizing packages from vape companies. Get away from stock coils all together. 
 Yeah i just watched a video about it, there is a chip and you put square shaped japanese cotton on it, however price is 100 dollars and you still have to change cotton as you said.
I'm a bit lazy, and to be honest i know atleast 10 people that doesn't start to vape because of this coil and re-wick mambo jambo. 
 If it was as easy as lighting up a cigarette, everyone would be doing it. Quitting's never easy! 
 Dude i just explained above, i know it's not easy that's not the point, i'm asking is there a new way and you just come here and saying some motivational poster sh*t. 
I wrote down hell of a post to avoid that kinda sh*t. 
 We're all adults here, you can say shit, it's ok. I also was the one that after reading your post, pointed out the chip coil.
You pointed out that 10 people you know haven't quit because of having to deal with coils and wicks... as in...it's not easy. It's a lot easier to say it's too hard and keep smoking.
What you want doesn't exist. So either pay money for stock coils and quit bitching about it, or spend the effort to do rebuildables. You have 2 options...

 From China? Begin worrying at week 6.  Assume it's lost by week 8.  China is cheap, but it isn't time efficient.   
 Dang that's a long time. So are the people that get it in like two weeks just really lucky haha? I hear of people getting it so fast; is that just luck even though technically it could take up to X weeks? 
 A bit of luck, yes.  With zero delays, 2 - 3 weeks is normal from China.  Frequently though, your package is going to hit multiple delays (customs, holidays, logistical screw ups, etc) at various hubs before it gets to your door. 
 I wouldn't worry, packages from China can take a while especially now since the holiday season is upon us and USPS is super busy.
I live in NY and my packages from China (usually from FT or 3F) usually take around 3 weeks to a month. I have gotten them earlier though but 3-4 weeks is the average for me.  
Hold tight and don't worry! I know just how frustrating it can be waiting to get your vape mail, especially if it's your first order from China. I hope it gets to you soon!
 Alright, thanks man! If it takes so long why does efun's website say 7-15 days via epacket shipping? 
 I think that's just the optimal shipping time, if absolutely everything goes as planned and that doesn't count the time it takes the vendor to actually ship the item out as well. Plus, you have to take in to account the time customs holds your package, they shipping company has no control over it. 
Like I said, while most of the time my packages from China take about 3 weeks, I've also had packages come in 2 weeks or less, the fastest I've had one delivered was 9 days. 
 Ok, well I'm going on three weeks now so fingers crossed this week or maybe next week because of Thanksgiving. 
 Yea I got my shit really cheap from ChYna but it always took really fucking long. 
 No kidding, have you ever used the efun.top site? 
 Usually about half my USPS status's from china don't update at all from that status until they hit San Fran. You need to give it a little more time. Give it 1 full month before you worry too much about it.
I've had good luck from all of the big Chinese sites, Fasttech, Gearbest, Efun, 3fvape. If you know what to expect, they provide great value for shit you don't care about getting right away. 
 So even though it said it was going to Chicago in the translated 17track info? I'm in Wisconsin if that makes a difference. 
 Yours will go to Chicago. West Coast usually lands in San Fran, East Coast lands in NY, and basically everywhere else lands in Chicago. 
 Ok interesting. Is Chicago customs really as bad as people say? 
 I don't know. My mom orders stuff that goes through Chicago customs  and I don't think she ever has any problems, but I doubt she pays much attention to her tracking. My packages go through New York. 
 San Fran, Chicago, where ever it's going. Half the time your status won't do a thing until it's already through customs. 
 So could it already be through customs? Or in customs? Or on US soil at all for that matter haha? 
 Yeah, it could be sitting in Chicago for processing currently. The Chicago hub is notoriously shitty, and it's the holiday season. 
It could also be sitting in line waiting on a ride over still, you just never know. Give it another couple weeks. 
 ugh, that is killing me. That's so bothersome not knowing where it is. Now honestly I just wanna get it so I can stop fretting about it lol. 
 Same experience all around the world. Give a full month before messaging the seller asking what's up.
Packages for China take a while to arrive, I would assume they also get extensively searched at customs. 
 All right, thanks man. It's just so frustrating not knowing where it is. 
 Yeah, I know what you mean, just put at least 4 or 6 weeks for delivery to be safe in the equation when ordering from China. 
Do note that I've only ordered from FastTech and as far as I've noticed my shipping statuses usually do get updated. I was monitoring my last order (and going to monitor that shipped just today) extensively, and it did get stuck at one point which judging by the notifications I was receiving was at some point between the two borders. I think my home country customs were responsible here since it was air transport allegedly. 
 Ok, like I said it's my first time ordering anything vape related and from a foreign country so I'm probably being a little too impatient. Mine hasn't been updated since the 9th saying it was still in China but I'm sure it has left China by now. I mean I don't know why it'd have to stay in China that long but oh well. I ordered Nov 6th so I'll wait until Dec. 6-9th ish to email efun again. I emailed them once already and all they had to say was it shipped then gave me my order number and a link to 17track.com, like, thanks that's really helpful. 
 That's a pretty common story for a first order, so I'm just walking you through the basics hehe. I think I emailed for my first order as well as I thought it was lost. Same as you, just got the same shipping number and confirmation that it was sent.
True enough, it arrived in my post a couple of days after that. 
 Ok that makes me hopeful haha, thanks for the responses. This quells my new buyer anxiety a bit. 
 Hoho.  Gonna go out and push myself here. [[ elixir M ]] -- it was originally modeled as a clone of halos kringles Kurse but with a spearmint base instead of peppermint.

 [[Melonlyptus]] or [[Extreme Menthol]] should do you right. My girlfriend smoked menthol camel crushes (with the ball popped) and she loves the Melonlyptus. You can also add an extra shot of menthol with Grayscale, if youre feeling daring. 
 Thanks for the reply.
I tried the extreme menthol from GSL and found it to be minty flavored with no menthol kick at all.  
 What /u/zestypotatoes said. I just tried it for the first time today and I can confirm that Melonlyptus definitely has that menthol kick. 
 Ah, what a misleading name then! I got it in 0 mg for when m'lady (/s) has to switch after Thanksgiving, so it technically hasn't been tasted yet, so I might've jumped the gun on the recommendation. But the Mentholyptus is solid!

 Mtbakervapor never offered 120's. They had 15,30,236. If you add 10 bottles of a flavour itll automatically deduct 20% then use coupon code redditvapers to deduct another 10%. So its $21.60 for 150ml (10x15ml) of [MBV-Menthol] (https://www.mtbakervapor.com/coupon-code-products/menthol-e-liquid/).

 Indigo vapors has some amazing tobacco flavors and I know they at least used to have a menthol tobacco. If she smokes lights I suggest using 6mg in the icare.
Aside from that, 50/50 PG/VG will work best in the icare.  
 awesome, thanks for the info :) 
 jwraps.com has a custom builder option. Although I've never used them, it might be what you're looking for. 
 Yea I checked that it seems to be for custom art work. I emailed them my lengths to see if they could. I not to familiar with wraps so I don't know what good sites are out there. Jwraps seems to be good. 
 Jwraps is my fave US based wraps, I've had great results. Zapwrapz if you're in UK or want to ship stickers across the world. 
 Just get rid of them and get new coils. Kanger coils are like, what $2/each at worst? Do you REALLY want to be vaping laundry detergent to save $4? 
 Haha yea, they definitely aren't expensive. I just get off work late tonight and those are the only extra coils I've got at the house. But I can use my other mod until I make it to the store tomorrow. Thanks for the response! 
 I dunno if I'd wanna be heating up and inhaling detergent residue meng. If they made it out with foil intact, *maybe* but if the foil broke and laundry water got into the cotton I'd toss em. 
 Didn't even think about that. You are 100% correct there haha. 
 What # is it? Nice looking mod by the way and GLWS.  
 It's #829. Thanks! 
 Thanks
 Supertank Mini?  The 22mm is only 3.5ml, but there's also at 25mm version that holds 5ml.  Coils are cheap and easily found, and you can also use Atlantis/Nautilus coils! 
 I probably should've gone with that for the coil availability. Instead I went with a super off brand Tobeco Mini super tank. I'll have to stuck up on coils online, or stick close to this vape shop that sells them.
It seems like a solid tank. Not sure if anyone has ever heard of this brand. Hopefully it's not made with any heavy metals or lead or anything like that. 
 That's the one I suggested!  Not an off brand at all.  It's quite reliable and has great flavor! 
 Hahaha.... ohh wow you're right. Somehow I missed that we were talking about the same tank.
Well thanks for the recommendation either way. The coil seems great so far.
So the brand is Tebeco? Seems like they came out of nowhere. Have they been around for a while? Where did they come from? 
 Tobeco is the manufacturer of the Super Tank and Super Tank Mini. They've been in the vape game for a while now-they started out making clones of RDA's and RTA's, then started making their own gear. Just about every post I've seen on the STM is positive, and the ability to use other company's coils is a plus. 
 Still love my subtank and top tank, should be a decent price

Hey, I ended up buying this tank. Tobeco Mini Super Tank.
Thanks for the advice though.
This tank seems off brandish. I've never heard of it at least. It feels pretty solid though. No leaking yet. Good flavor.
Supposedly this tank is really battery efficient. No clue how true that is, but I'm excited to try it out. 
 Phenomenal tank!  I get 2-3 weeks out of my coils, and switch juices almost every other tankful.  No lingering flavors, either!
 Just grab a nautilus or nautilus mini and be done with it imo. :)
Old tank but a fantastic vape. Can use the BVC coils or the triton mini  clapton coils ( I recommend the triton mini claptons though, crazy flavor ) 
 I'm gonna go ahead and hope that no one is stupid enough to try that.
Secretly, though, that's an idiotic thing to hope for... 
 18650's are in use by flashlight's and shit, that's what those batteries are intended for, anybody buying and using a battery for flashlights and low amperage usage for vaping, shouldn't be vaping in the first place.  
 I use those in my noisy cricket! 
 I don't think WalMart actually has a vape section do they? Aren't these just batteries? 
 Honestly your original spaced .5ohm is what ive found to be the best on the serpent mini (i have the 25mm version).
With the mini, less is more with wick. You want so little your worried about it, then it will be perfect lol. 
 I'm assuming you mean going down into the juice channels? Yeah I've found that you can cut them very short without it leaking, mine barely touch the ledge in the middle. 
I'm experimenting with different thicknesses of cotton in the coil though. Using kendo it's hard to judge the right amount to use and get it feeling right with the right amount of resistance. I used the pads that came with the tank this time and noticed that spitting became a non-issue which it always was before.  
 i just put in a spaced 24g Kanthal 5/6 wrap around 2.5mm coming in at about .43 ohms. i found it more enjoyable than the dual fused claptons and twisted 26g contact coils i had tried previously. great flavor and minimal ramp up time at 22-25 watts. 
 I'm watching [this review](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlbmK-7lcPI&t=722s) in which he uses the exact same contact build, and thinking *how the hell is he pushing this thing to 55 watts!* 
 I have been almost exclusively vaping on my 25mm Serpent Mini. I have been backing back down south of 40w but I regularly vape at 45w. I accidentally vaped it at 55w for hours until I realized that I was getting dry in a sudden way. However, other times, if I chuff a few times in a row in relatively quick succession it'll get a little toasty on we as a gentle warning that she's about to dry up. I think I probably wick about the same as you from the sounds of it. However, I will say, I vape 28 or 26g contact Claptons and build for about 1.2ohm on a 3.0-3.5mm mandrel. 
All that said, I've actually been thinking lately that I would do a spaced for the first time in this tank the next time I rebuild.  
 You can't question the Scottish reviewer. They did invent the Scottish roll after all. 
For some strange reason the best wicking videos I've seen are from UK guys too. Something has to be in the water there. 
 I've tried clapton, fused clapton, twisted clapton, alien, spaced, micro, SS, Ni and even catterpilar track coils. These were either too warm or too cold, too much vapor or not enough. IMO the goldie locks build for me is  Kanthal 26g twisted , 6 wraps on 2.5 mm . 0.6 ohms @ 35w . 
 I think the included twisted coils were 28ga which I struggled to push past 30 watts. I might have to try twisted 26ga at some point, just as something different since I don't have any experience with claptons. 
 That is the exact build I use, but I use 26g SS.
Edit: Also at 35w... 
 I would try and use a larger id coil. It really helped me with dry hits. I have the 25 mm version, and stuff almost the largest diameter 26ga ss316l coil I can in mine. 0.9 and no dry hits up to 40 watts. Try trimming your wick to as little as possible.  
 Thanks for the responses. I think I'll stick with the spaced 24ga build for now since I'm getting pretty good flavour at 30 watts.
Also, what airflow settings do you guys use? Another thing I find myself unable to decide on - between half way and fully open. 
 So the sound after is your wick being burnt. It's from not enough juice. I found I'm having a lot of trouble with vacuum with this tank. The only thing I've found that fixes it is loosening the top cap just a little when you start vaping and close when finished. You should see bubbles coming from the juice channels up into the tank. If you keep the top closed you won't see these bubbles which means they are trapped inside and drying you wick which is causing the sound after your done and your dry hits.  
 The only build I've had in my mini for more than a day is 28awg/32awg nichome clapton 7 wrap 2.5mm .66ohms 22-27 watts. Ive tried ss spaced 26, twisted kanthal, other claptons. Just keep cpming back to the 28/32. 
 Take your tank off and give the button in the well of the pico a couple of pushes with a pen.  It should come back up.  The one my wife has will occasionally get stuck and not connect with the tank.  Pushing it up and down a couple of times solves the problem.  
 My costs this year are under $200. 
Gotta love DIY.  
 Right on. OP is the anomaly of vaping when your kind of careless about your spending. How many mods and atomizers can you possibly get for 260$ in a single month? I limit my spending to no more than 30$ in a single purchase and this seems to be my key to keeping things cheap.  
 And I bet $160 of that are from flavorings sitting in the drawer that will probably never see light again too :-)  
 Looks like you need to pop over to r/DIY_ejuice 
 the best part is it's mostly giveaway winnings.  only once a month that I buy without a giveaway....
but I do have a good stash of unopened stuff  1280 ml. 
 Then this isn't what you actually spent at all.  Winning expensive ejuice doesn't count as an expenditure. 
 in this is just the amount I paid (shipping etc), not msrp 
 The @'s post is still valid though. In April alone you could have purchased 1,500ml of quality nicotine from nudenicotine for example that would last you and your entire city for 3 months. 
I still have some of their free 15ml sample they give out in the freezer and that had to be 3 months ago now. I made it stretch by lowering my nic to 2-5mg instead of 6 waiting for Black Friday but by doing so I'm totally used to it which is a plus. 
 My apologies I misunderstood your post.  I do agree with some of the posts though about getting into diy if you want to save money.  Very inexpensive and pretty easy. 
 more of a time concern here....  and what a rabbit hole to go down! 
 Man I am glad im too lazy to add dup all i have bought!
It's addicting, isn't it? 
 yeah.  but for gear it sure doesn't seem like I have $900 worth! 
 Were you a cigarette smoker? If so, how much would you have spent on them during this year? 
 That was instantly my thought, as well!
I was a pack-a-day smoker, and my brand was $6 (when on sale or purchased in a carton.) that's $2190 per year. In which case, without doing the math, I think i'm still *slightly* ahead. 
 Toward the end more like a pack every three days. So spending more on vaping. But I'm ok with it really.  
 I'm 8 months in to my vaping adventure . . .and honestly scared to total it all up.  Spent a lot on juice (still working through the stockpile) to determine what companies/flavors I like.  I've pretty much completed that adventure, and have all the hardware I need (I think haha)

This is awesome - thanks for linking to it! 
 Glad to help!
I keep a spreadsheet for all the companies/juices I've tried, and when I went to post my first review, I just wanted to be able to export that section of my spreadsheet, which led to some Googling/Reddit searching that led me to that.
With that add-in, it's a piece of cake to export tables in Reddit format with no issues.
Take care! 8) 
 Missing the total column, I need to see the real yearly damage 
 2091.14
the shame. 
 Look at it like this.  If you had a Pack a Day habit of cigarettes, and using Numbo's national average of $6.50/pack for a pack of Marlboros, you'd be looking at a total cost of $2373.00/year on cigarettes.  So, just by that math you're on the right side by almost $200. 
 And consider the health benefit. You're up $200 and you're living a much healthier lifestyle. I'd consider that a win. 
 I did think about that. But towards the end I was more of a pack every three days. But money isn't the only reason! 
 This looks very similar to my first year vaping totals. Thank goodness my second decelerated. Enjoy 
 The hell kinda juice do you vape, and do you vape it on a fuccin fire? 
 mostly favorites of this sub.... yet to try any premium stuff. 
 i think the word premium is a joke for overpriced juice. the only juice that i've had that i'd pay nearly half of what you paid a month for is One Hit Wonder
 
 That one should be easy to DIY. Add 1% of any strawberry flavor, 1% of any cream flavor, and about 18% sweeter.  
 Refers to the price tag and amount of sweetener used in the recipe. 
 I used to keep track of how much I spent on vaping. It was a depressingly large amount of money. A lot more than I spent on tobacco (I mainly rolled my own).
So, I fixed the problem: I stopped keeping close tabs on how much I spend and focus on the fact that I?ve been cigarette-free for nearly 5 years, feel worlds better, no longer reek of smoke, and have a very enjoyable hobby to boot. 
When I look at it that way, it would be cheap at twice the price. 
 I definitely feel better! 
 My chart would look fairly similar. More juice heavy though. Smokes are pricey here; at a pack a day it's roughly a $4800 a year addiction. Going by my old cigarette budget I can afford a new setup weekly. 
 That's like $92/pack?!?! 
 365 days in a year...
4800/365 = 13.15
How did you get 92? 
 Haha haha!!! Duuuuhhbhhh!!! Cuz I'm not very smart today. Divided by 52 ( weeks of the year ) it's 92. 
Sometimes I'm dumb. 
 They must have lost track of calculations because $92 is the weekly cost of $13.15 a pack.
When I quit, packs were between $12.75 and $14 depending on the store.  
 DIY! Get some rebuildable hardware and start making your juice. I am so glad I starting DIY'ing almost immediately, I vape premium recipes for a stupidly low cost. My partner recently got me a stash of premium juice for our anniversary and I preferred my DIY stuff over just about everything in the stash she got me. Let me know if you need any leads on good info for getting started. Now, I just spend money on awesome hardware and flavorings. 
 I do rebuild.... since I can barely find the time to experiment with that I doubt I can find the time to DIY.... 
 Sorry I didn't mean to sound presumptuous of your time or schedule, I'm just super happy with my own savings so I tend to preach it where I can. That's great- coils can add up too. Honestly, I find it easier to mix up a recipe (and there's tons of great ones available, no tinkering needed) than go to a B&amp;M or even shop online every time I need to restock. Regardless, whatever works for you is the way to go. Good luck :) 
 no offense was taken.  I have two young children so I have no time to myself!
how much must one layout to start DIY? 
 I have children myself and a lot on the table. But a wise man once told me you always have time to do what you want. When you change that mentality from I don't have time your life will change. Not criticizing just giving some advice.  
 I hear that.  But I haven't even gotten to video gaming in a while (and that's high on my list)!
if the FDA silliness holds then it's back on the table for sure! 
 I think a lot of people, like me too, see everything you can buy for DIY and get lost and just can't figure out where to start, even with the DIY sub. I think it would be awesome if they put together a few lists of things to buy to make a group of flavors like sweets, savory, and deserts with a selected nic level and preferred VG/PG mix and be good to go. 
 There is a bit of a learning curve but it's not nearly as scary as it seems. I mod a small DIY subreddit and maybe we'll do that. We offer mixing mentors, experienced users that are buddied up with newcomers, but a go to reference like that would be great. I might write it myself.  
 If you do I would love to check it out! I would love to check out the sub too. 
 I'll keep you posted! Our sub is r/mixersclub. We have some of the best DIYers offering to mentor, and they're happy to do it. If you have any questions at all or would like to become a member you are absolutely welcome. 
 1) VG/PG - 5 bottles of VG, 3 of PG from Vapewild. 32$ with free shipping = 1980ml does roughly 80 bottles of juice. I wouldn't buy their nic though. 
 
2) Nicotine from wizard labs or anyone comparable about 16$ for 120ml around 20$ w shipping. If you mix 3mg this does 133 bottles of juice. 
3) flavoring I get at onestopdiyshop. This is where it gets more down to personal experience. But you get 30ml bottles for 4$. They can go far or they can go fast depending how and what you mix. I also use a 15% coupon on everything I get with them. Some things I buy 15mls for 2$, this boils down to the user but it's still cheap. 
4) bottles pipettes and syringes - you could spend 30$ and have a ton of these. 
Someone who vapes 10-15ml could easily achieve this under 150$ and have a 4-6 month supply. The rest of it is really research and time but @ 15-20$ for a 30ml at the B&M its def worth it.  
 I'm afraid to do this. I don't wanna know! 
 Do you only buy authentic gear and top of the line juice? 
> nearly 270 dollars of gear in a single month
Damn lol. You should post a pic of some of the gear you have. 
 I didn't think I buy fancy stuff but that one month likely had my purchase of a DNA200 in it!  and mostly juices from suppliers that frequent this sub.
I have yet to buy a clone.... but I don't buy the expensive stuff. 
 ive probably matched you in juice. just recently picked up DIY and im enjoying my clone. Im pretty stingy on hardware though. ive only bought 1 tank and and 1 RDTA in the past 3 months. no mods either. i need to buy a new mod so my RX can become the backup. soon TM 
 i was pretty stingy, but bought a few RTA/rdas lately.  I should probably get off my duff and sell some of the ones I don't use! 
 Wow... paid $30 for my vaporizer, and I spend <$40/month on juice and coils. 
I must be doing something very wrong 
 I work from home so I vape all goddamn day!  bout 15 mls or so.
 \#lifegoals 
 more like I can not goal perse....  a goal would be to change my underwear more than 3x a week. 
 Jesus,
I spent 400 dollars, and I don't DIY.
Y'all are crazy.  
 Y'all are ~~crazy~~ stupid.  fixed that for you 
 Someone is buying stuff to cover up their daddy issues ..... 
 maybe if they were all mech mods.... ew, see what you made me say? 
 I know the feeling..last month spent $300 on a Metal Moose & Kennedy but I had to have it..told myself this month I wasn't going to buy anything, got the Noisy Cricket II, only $30 though!   
 I've spent about 3 thousand Australian dollars over the past year. This past month I've wasted about a grand on garbage such as the reuleaux 200s, the tesla three, countless DIY-juice-ingredients that turned out to be utter shit, spools of exotic wires that I dont like, 10+ tanks that aren't being used because they're garbage. The sad thing is, i really want the Petri lite V2 mech mod but i refuse to spend anymore. When I started vaping, I never intended to have a sizeable collection of vaping gear, I never intended to be a hobbyist, I am not a collector, I just wanted to quit smoking. Nonetheless, I'm still smoking (but much less, thanks to vaping). Maybe someday I'll find the perfect set-up... 
 yeah you think you're all set then some new tank comes out you get it and meh.... 
 EDIT: nevermind, I totally misread your chart. 
 Woah that's quite a lot of costs. What kind of devices do you like buying? What made you rack up to such a high amounts per month? 
 Shit I've got close to $400 worth of gear just in my hand....and that's not counting all of my other mods, atomizers, and juice. I really don't want to add everything together to find out how much I've spent over the years.... 
 i only have 2 mods (kbox70 and efusion duo) and 7 tanks!
 
 my god u spent more on ecig stuff than I do on car insurance.  
 I spend just about the same on insurance. Though that's for 2 cars a house and motorcycle lol 
 i mean outside of holding an intervention and making things really awkward, there isn't much you can do. 
honestly if you have a B&M that lets you sample juices, take him one day and let him try some juices, he may just need to find something he likes, or even just needs a tobacco flavor.
with black friday coming up you could get him a MTL setup on the cheap like an eGo AIO, and just gift it to him. With him having his own, he might guilt himself into using it.
It's a shitty situation OP and I wish i could give you some more helpful advice, but sadly I'm at a loss. 
 That's something a few of us have been thinking of doing, he mentioned having his own but only if we kept it at someone else's place and not his. 
Thank you  
 It's his decision ultimately. I don't get that he won't commit because of his biker gang's views (at 20 years old?) If that's the case, he should realize his health is more valuable than their opinions.
I'd love to see my buddy stop smoking/vape instead, too. He's 20 and he picked up smoking after I let him try cigs from me. Then I started vaping instead, he kept smoking. He still does and hides it from his family, saying they'd be more pissed if he vaped rather than smoked cigs... I don't get it - but you can't force anyone to do anything so let's hope they make the best decision for themselves. 
 It sounds broken.  
 Just got it today 
 Put it in vinegar for 20 mins. It should help 
 Same answer. You can also add sodium bicarbonate.
I recommend you to get an ultrasonic cleaner btw. 
 +1 for the ultrasonic cleaner. Picked one up on eBay for �10, 'tis awesome. Rip the tank apart, chuck it in and 3 minutes later it's sparkling.  
 Which cleaner did you pick up? 
 can the base be taken apart? i tried doing so but it looked to be in 1 piece. thanks for the answers btw!  
 is the tank still safe to use with this kind of rust? anything to worry about? 
 Iron oxide, rust, is not toxic in any way. If it is more then surface rust there might be other alloy elements detached. I have no medical background, but I don�t think you have anything to worry about. 
 as /u/station_nine correctly pointed out, FDA can say it is reasonably intended to be used with a tobacco product thus making it a component.  Outside of a vape shop, its just a charger, unless you somehow market it as for use with vaping. 
 Batteries not built in mods aren't manufactured for vaping, neither are the chargers. 
 But what about chargers sold at vape shops? I bet the FDA will say it's for vaping. 
 The charges sold in vape shops are the same ones sold at lightbulbs plus, batteries n bulbs etc... hell and wal mart for that matter.
If a vape shop has a cooler at the register, does Coca-Cola need to apply for a PTMA? 
 You're not following the FDA's twisted logic well enough. Because a battery charger sold in a vape shop is reasonably intended to be used with vape batteries (which are, of course, tobacco products), it is essential for the safety of our citizens to make sure each charger has undergone clinical lab testing! 
 If someone buys a coke to get relief from their vaper's tounge, then it could be. 
 Literally the second result on VapeCrawler.
https://www.eciggity.com/hcigar-vt133-box-mod/ 
 Vaporshark/Lostvape had some pretty nice DNA devices last I checked.
Found at plenty of retailers or directly sold from them. I would suggest using a web crawler to search for the specific model for shops in your area. 
 I'd talk to /u/PalmBeachVaper (hope I tagged the right person) and get one built! He does super clean work from what I've seen. 
 Rip a sick as tits cloud and let it strangle them with its bare hands!  
 Sounds like somethin a good ole drop kick to the throat would fix! 
Then, while they're gasping for air on the ground, rip a fat cloud in their face and whisper clouds bro, clooouuuddddsssss 
 If they're smokers, you could always tell them at least you're not destroying your lungs.. but most people would just laugh at something like that. But honestly, it's 2016 so if people are still judging other people for something like vaping, there's a 100% chance they're a piece of shit. So you should just known you're better than them and at least you can make sick clouds! 
 Usually I just eat on them for an obvious flaw. U lift bro? Your boyfriend doesn't mind it I know it seems complex to you 3 buttons is a lot to figure out. I'm sure you'll get there eventually my vape gets more action than you do 
 A liberal arts college isnt pro vaping?? What is happening to this world!?!?  
 Just tell them you enjoy suckin your robo-dick and carry on with your life.  
 Own the stereotype. Who gives a shit what others feel any way. If you aren't being a dick while you vape, fuck them.  
 Tell them you don't judge them for sucking dick, so they shouldn't judge you for sucking in vapor. 
 Just ignore them. 
 Fuck them and keep blowing clouds bro 
 A liberal arts college isnt pro vaping?? What is happening to this world!?!?  
 Buy another one, don't buy an alien 
 I agree , i have a few iPV III's , incredibly tough and reliable .  I would never buy a Smoke , Joytech or E leaf over one of these.
If a mod does not have a YiHi or DNA chipset i am not interested lol. 
 Is it giving you the issues with any tank/atomizer? 
 Yeah I forgot to mention it was shorting on a build in a different atomizer as well. Also I threw the original atomizer on my backup mod and no issues have occurred other than the fact that I like this build at ~90 watts and my backup mod maxes at 50w 
 Clean the firing button with alcohol and a qtip then check and see if the insulator around the positive pin is still intact, mine is made of some type of gasket material and has started to crumble. 
 I took my first ipv3li apart when I broke the screen. I will have to say that all the wiring is stuffed into a tight spot. the board is wedged into the box. it's a pain in the ass to get into and put back together 
 actually I just took mine apart and it's nothing like the first one I had. it's pretty easy to get into.

 You mean [Smok Alien 220w TC] (http://www.vapordna.com/SMOKtech-Alien-220W-TC-Box-Mod-p/smalbm.htm?1=1&CartID=1) for $40 with coupon code VTRz7Zws5k.  
 It's a popular and well rated and inexpensive mod, I am just not crazy about the looks. I feel it's a little on the ostentatious side 
 The [Smoant Battlestar 200w TC] (http://www.vapordna.com/Smoant-Battlestar-200W-TC-Box-Mod-p/smbtsr.htm?1=1&CartID=2) is another great mod. Check out Rip Trippers and Vaping With Vic's youtube review on it. Its $39 with coupon code VTRz7Zws5k.  
 Someone else recommended it to me the other day. Another quality looking mod that is just plain old ugly to me lol 
 This is my last link lol. You'll definitely like this one. The [VaporFlask Classic 150w TC] (http://www.vaporbeast.com/vapor-flask-classic.html) on sale for $47 with coupon code yeahbaby.  
 It's actually not that bad, seems pretty unbiased.
The dudes stupid ass skunk haircut pisses me off watching it though. 
 I agree, the only part that I think it wrong is about the FDA regulating e-liquids.  it's really a ban on everything before 2007.  That's not regulations, that just a straight up ban! 
 I occasionally vape 1ml in a good pull. 
 Sounds about right. I have a .12 build that does this  
 I used to vape ~25ml a day I'm gown to around 10ml/day 
 ya - I just dont know how much is a lot. I stopped smoking analogues about three years ago. Started on 5-10ml a day w/ high nic ...but now I'm down to about a tank a day (2mL).  
 About 30 cubic feet of vapor a day, give or take.   
 shit I have 3 tanks (the various tfv8s). I swap all day, and fill them all from half at least 2 times. I would guess like 15ml a day on a good day?
If i'm not working it's probably like in the 25+ml a day. 
 About 10ml of 12mg nicotine in my kayfun v4 at 14 watts.  
  I'd say about 15ml a day at either 1.5 - 3mg. 
 about 5-6 ml a day and usually 3mg or 6mg depending on what I have around. Quickly moving to 3mg though. 
 I vape roughly 15ml of 3mg every day. I don't know if this is on the high side but I know people that vape less. 
 Chemically stripped using paint remover. Let it sit in there for about 15 minutes then scrubbed it down and picked out some stubborn bits with a toothpick. Repeated once more, then washed in soapy then plain water. Replaced the red seals with black ones. My main concern prior to doing this was the paint stripper damaging the airflow adjuster, but the stripper didn't have an effect on it.
It has turned out really nice.
The finishes on the subox and Subtank mini are garbage, paint started coming off both within days. The Subtank is a great tank (what I really like is that a tank will last a day, unlike my uwell crown).
(Sorry for the new post, my images disappeared from imgur so I deleted the my old post)   
 great idea! will do this to mine too .... would be nice if this could be done to the kbox - the thing looks like it came out of a warzone :| 
 I bought a Stainless Steel one back in the day and it still looks perfect, the black one I have like yours looks like complete shit. May have to do this. Thanks man! 
 Kangertech must be using real cheap paints... I have older mods that look much better than my subox. 
 my rx2/3 is longer in use than my kbox and still looks like new. same is true for my moonshot (also black) ...
don't know what kanger did (or did not) use here 
 I basically only buy SS attys.  I do have 2 Velocity mini's that I got so cheap I bought them anyway.  At least they have no paint on the inside.
And yes the Subtank Mini is a very underappreciated tank.  Love them with the RBA.
 Buying a painted tank was a noob mistake... Now I'll only buy SS. 
 Nicely done!  
 I did the same thing... but used an 300 grit sand paper, which left the black paint in the embossed areas and gave it a brushed metal looked look. I like the looks of it. 
 When I was stripping it some paint remained in the lettering and looked really cool, but it was too late to change my mind at that stage.
How was using sandpaper to remove the paint? How did you get the paint off the chimney and inside/top of the tank? 
 Pic: https://i.imgur.com/zfkl2X9.png
It's pretty beat up now (It's been demoted to my emergency/beater tank for long/drunken/rugged trips)
The sandpaper-ing actually went pretty quick. By the time I did it, most of the paint was already flaked off anyways. (I'm hard on my gear). Yep, did the inner steel behind the glass too. I skipped the chimney inside, didn't think of it at the time. Thanks a lot... now that's bothering me ;) 
 I also did the same but left the inside and the engravings outside black looks really good with my striped ipv d2 with black battery door. 
 Nice touch keeping the drip piece black. And the black seals do make the sub-tank look better IMO. Use them on mine too, and have the iSubG drip tip on it as it has a wider aperture.    
 I'll definitely be doing this, I've found christ knows how many flakes of paint in my vape juice 
 I threw one of those in the trash today. I should have sanded it down and kept for a spare. 
 I'd grab the Hohm Wrecker G2 for $45
http://www.vaporcube.com/h-wrecker-g2-hohm-wrecker-171w-temperature-control-box-mod-limited-edition.html
Only one color left, Dodger Blue BUT!
Use Code G2Flash and its $45
Get the Tsunami...and some pre-made coils for $25 bucks at VapeNW
Use code: BLKFRDY
and have $30+- $5 in your pocket...
 My advice for your current budget 
Mods 
Rx200/200s rx2/3 or coolfire and for the rda tsunami 22/24 i think this would suit your budget nicely 
 I second the rda for sure.  
 Fuck the Tsunami it's garbage. I got a goon clone for less than an authentic Tsunami and it's 100 times better.  TBH my goon clone is pretty much identical to my authentic goon. That's just my opinion though, some people swear by the Tsunami.  
 Don't take it. Get a disposable cigalike if you need to. 
 I was stationed at a MEPS. If you're just going for your screening, you can take it. Leave it in your bag when you leave the hotel in the morning. You'll get it back when your recruiter comes to take you home. 
If you're shipping out (which it sounds like you aren't), don't take it. You won't see it for months and it could go missing or be thrown.  
 This is my first trip to MEPS, but I would just like to be sure because my recruiter said I'll be taking all my stuff with me the next morning and not returning to the hotel. 
 I almost forgot - when you're at MEPS, act like an adult. They are not your parents. Do not sleep, do not put your feet up, clean up after yourself and be respectful of the staff. We used to pick a few that acted like shitheads every day for our personal slaves to clean. 
 Is this your first or second time going to meps? If memory serves me correctly (it's been a while) you'll go to meps twice. The first time is for all the BS to ensure you're fit to join. The second time is when you'll be on your way to basic. Someone feel free to correct me if I'm wrong and it's possible the process has changed since I went through. If this is the case and you're not headed directly to basic after the fact then I'd say you can bring it. If you're headed to basic immediately after then don't bring it unless you don't care it gets trashed.  
 You are correct on the process, and this is only my first trip going to MEPS. I just don't want them trashing it because I'm supposed to be bringing my stuff with me and they'll be checking my bag. 
 Take a cigalike and put a pen cap on it preferably opaque.  
 Depending on the branch you're going into, they'll throw it out at the beginning of training, send it home, or it'll be stuffed away for a bit. I'd say, just leave it. You won't be using it for at least two months, so it'll give you an opportunity to quit completely. 
 Meps isn't basic dumbass  
 I know. He's swearing in though, which means he's gonna be going to basic. My advice was to not bring it anyway if he swearing in because he's going to basic. 
 The njoy's are pretty decent for the price as long as you don't mind MTL obviously. I would grab one of those.  
 Dude don't do it, They throw all your belongings in a bay you wont see till you pass AIT/graduate. in that time your batteries could go bad and compromise all the shit other people have too. It's not worth it because you'll only be using it at the hotel. Once you get to the state you'll be doing your BCT you just wont have any time. 
You will lose all your electronics bro. Just wait till you graduate AIT/A school 
 Don't take it. It will be considered contraband. They don't like to deal with any minor shit that takes time away from what they want to do. Also, don't take any vape gear to boot camp/basic training. Have your someone mail all your shit to you after you settle down a bit at AIT. If some rules still apply like it did while I was there, you won't be able to smoke/use tobacco products even in AIT unless you're AIT is long and you phase up from Black --> Gold --> Green.  
 Don't do it.  You will regret it later when you get it back, that is if they let you keep it.  After being there a week or so they have you dump everything on your bed and go through it. If they find something they do not like they will have you toss it.  Just get a disposable and toss it at your last flight out. 
 Was just looking myself the other day.
http://www.vaporauthority.com/products/genuine-kanger-ssocc-stainless-steel-replacement-coils-atomizer-heads-5-pack
And here's an article for people who think all the coils are stainless steel.
http://www.vaporauthority.com/blogs/news/75513093-clearing-up-the-confusion-about-the-kanger-ssocc-coils 
 Aspire Cleito. Best Flavor tank I have ever had and they have SS coils that I use TC with every day. 
 if she wants a tight draw like a cigarette get her a aspire nautilius or a icare kit 
 The icare kit would be more suitable if she buys the dispoables at the corner store. It works by just inhaling and its nice and small. So it wouldn't be too new. If you think she's willing to upgrade then definitely get the nautilis tank. 
 I'd definitely say the Joyetech AIO , best vaping device in my opinion for people quiting smoking and getting on the vape! Tight draw and mouth to lung so it will feel like she's smoking! Decent battery and easy to maintain when I had mine for over a year I never had a single problem, plus you can get them for 20-30 dollars 
 If you REALLY want a pen kangertech AIO but personally the Icare outperforms it, is simpler and smaller.

 I've ordered the Northland one and I'll have it in 2 days. I'll let you know what I think when I get a chance to vape it. Their other juices are great (with the exception of earl grey, which wasn't really my sort of thing but did taste exactly like earl grey tea) so I've got high hopes 
 For sure let me know how it is. I'm already a big fan of the m3 and nuts&cream!

 Honeysuckle My Cuke is fantastic, which I'm sure you've already gathered from the other responses.  I thought I disliked mint flavors until I tried it.  Also, pair it with a glass of sweet tea, the combination is wonderful.

 MBV has one, but the shelf life is terrible. only get a small bottle of it and vape it fast! 
 AV timekeeper or anything from them, Kennedy Ruby or roundhouse, Subohm innovations shorty/legendary, metal moose. 
 Badass? Rogue, SOI shorty with SS switch and cap etc.  
 I think the Limitless is pretty badass 
 Where can I get one from? 
 Tvl colt 45  
 I love the AV complyfe able mech personally plus it has interchangeable sleeves 
 Anything from AV or Kennedy 
 I did it in mspaint. Just set up a 32*128 pixel canvas, then save as 24bit BMP. You have to save it as negative though, for some reason it'll display the reverse.
Just passing time. 
 Any chance you could pm me a little description on how to do this? I have the same mod and didn't know it had the ability for custom stuff  
 That's badass. I just got this mod Friday, it's a beast. Looks like I've got some work to do. 
 that looks awesome!!! 
 SICK!! Dude share that bitmap 
 Have it, liked it (first RDA), but hated the condensation spewing out of the air holes. Still go back to it every once in a while though.  
 I don't mind the condensation too much, it would be alot worse if the airflow didn't start at the sides and instead ended at the very bottom of the RDA like the original Kennedy.
Even if I do fill the juice well up to the top of the airflow holes: the condensation that results is still manageable. Any juice that falls into the holes gets sucked back into the coils..... I just have to not tilt my mod until I get through my 30+ bigass hits (.18 build at 80 watts for an ice cold vape). 
 If you were to take it to Home Depot or something could they find Phillips screws that would fit or are they just totally incompatible and I'm dumb 
 I went to multiple rc car shops, machine shops, etc... the problem is the fact that its a machine screw that I don't have the size/thread notation shit for.... thankfully, its not below metric or I would have a tougher time finding a suitable replacement.
Doesn't help that I have no access to a thread gauge or a caliper. 
 Hm I was just curious  
 Wasn't trying to shit on you, just highlighting the lengths I went to to fix the screw issue 
 Lol u good brotha  
 My airflow tubes are shaky af and stuffing them back doesn't help. 
 Really? I've never had that problem. 
 What battery are you using? 
 'Kamry' I don't know much about batteries but I just googled it and they don't have a good reputation it seems?  
 Yep, sounds like a case of shit batteries that aren't suitable for vaping use. Pick yourself up a Samsung 30Q, LG HG2, or Sony VTC6, and I'll bet the problem disappears. 
 Thanks for the tip. I'm gonna have a browse for batteries now! 
 Also, since it seems like you may not be informed about the deep world of batteries, take a few minutes to look into battery safety. Using unknown brand batteries and commercial rewraps is inherently unsafe, so I'm wondering if you may be unaware of some other safety issues that you might have. Even something seemingly small like a small nick in the battery covering could have catastrophic results!  
 Thanks :) I'm familiar with the basics but couldn't hurt to read up a little more!  
 You might wanna get another battery for $5. If you're going to use an external charger you mind as well have 2 batteries. In fact maybe get 2 bc your battery might be toast.
[LG HG2] (http://www.illumn.com/18650-lg-18650g2-3000mah-high-discharge-flat-top.html). 
 Yeah good thinking, I'm in UK so I'll find a different supplier - you'd recommend that battery though? 
 Ya. Shit i cant remember the name of that uk battery seller. They have great prices. Maybe make a post asking. *EDIT* You can get two [Samsung 30q's] (http://m.ebay.co.uk/itm/122214532629?_mwBanner=1) from Torchy. Hes a reliable uk seller. Or from [Nkon] (https://eu.nkon.nl/samsung-inr-18650-30q-3000mah.html). 
 Cheers, I'll have a little google and will post if I cannot find somewhere decent :) 
 I found them. I edited my previous comment.  
 Thanks! Much appreciated, I'll check them out 
 Vapor production sucks, and lots of dry hits. Would not recommend. 
 Cigs aren't wicked correctly. Plus paper isn't a great metal to begin with. Maybe that's why. 
 I've found that one or two drunken cigarettes every year or so is great reminder of how much better vaping really is.  
 Taste is shit but the buzz utterly destroys vaping.
I still respect cigs, but not having an addiction to them anymore is pure bliss. 
 I vape 3mg nic. Occasionally I fill up a Kabuki tank with 6mg. After 5 hits, I'm buzzed like I can't hardly walk. 
 I personally still love the taste. And one of the best things about vaping for me is that I can sit down, and really enjoy a cigarette once every few weeks. And not get hooked again or crave more afterwards, but just enjoy the one. 
 meh, if you want a buzz, I started on 36mg years ago.
Also ..  hold your breath, a lot of it is CO2.
 From experience with smokeless tobacco, CO2 is not responsible for much of the buzz.
Honestly though, just grabbing a simple device and puffing seems like bliss compared to the cluster-fuck that ejuice, mods, batteries, tanks, drippers, coils, and wicks are. I've been researching vaping for about a month and I'm just tired of it. 
 You want cluster-fuck? Try getting Chinese atomizers to work from back in the day with their terrible juice. No the tech these days is so simple. People were using tea bags and blue foam as wick. THAT'S a cluster-fuck my friend. You have it easy today because those people dealt with those struggles and made it better. 
 My benchmark is the simplicity of a cigarette. Nothing really compares. Though, in another 5 years we will look back at all these bulky, complicated devices and yet again say THAT was a clusterfuck, now we have it easy heh.
I did spend $300 back ~10 years ago on some POS cigalike that was at a mall kiosk. Fuck me, I think I used it for 2 days, whilst continuing to smoke, then gave it to a friend... 
 No we won't, we'll probably still be using the same gear, since the FDA is fucking us. 
 I feel as though if they get any more simple, they will lose some sort of customization or functionality. But yeah, you might be right lol I haven't tried many starter kits but look into a Nautilus mini. Its an older tank, but a great one! 
 Mate I started over 8 years ago and have seen so many 'this is the greatest' things come and go that I just stick with what works for me. egos, cartos, genesis, tanks, drippers .. yawn.
For the last year or so, evic vtc-mini, kanger subtank mini, 5 wraps 26 gauge, cotton wool, unflavoured juice at 4mg, 20% vg at 15W or so.
Change cotton wool every few weeks and wind a coil every few months.
I lie slightly, gave the evic to the missus and been using a Heatvape invader mini cause it was on special for $10 for the last few months.
 What do you mean by Cotton wool...? Do you mean just plain old cotton or is it a different form of cotton? 
I don't think using real wool would be advisable...I can only imagine the smell of it if it burnt..Oh god would that be bad! 
 Yeh cotton balls, which we call cotton wool, as opposed to cotton fabric I guess. 
 >For the last year or so, evic vtc-mini, kanger subtank mini, 
For years I was always looking for the next thing, getting excited by shiny tanks and mods. Then I got that same setup and was happy. 
A few months ago, I swapped out the subtank mini for an Innokin Axiom, I like the smaller size tank, and I haven't even been paying attention to what's out now. I'll be ok this until it dies I think.  
 I've been using Kayfuns since I bought my first one. It's my sweet spot. Never felt a need to upgrade, until I lost the refil screw on both of my Kayfun Lite's, and looked at the reviews for the Mini 3 and 5. Bought both, and I'm happy again. I have a IPV2s, and a Kanger Subbox mod, and both are rock solid. I got a cheap velocity clone for the few times I feel like clouds, or I'm testing DIY. 
The only thing I buy is DIY supplies, and I'll probably need batteries soon. I have enough kanthal and cotton for a couple of years. I don't expect to replace anything unless I break or lose them. I'm pretty happy where I am! I never got onto the gear hamster wheel. 
 I see myself spending too much time and hundreds of dollars chasing the best ecig hardware & juices.
So, yeah, I would rather just get a cheap, not-awful device and call it done. I guess juices will always be a pain in the ass, but that's kinda why I'm gravitating to the closed-system devices that force me to choose from just a few flavors. The Juul is looking nice. 
 I had the same mindset as you and was doing the same thing, came to the same conclusion.. Ended up with a Pico and an iCare with nic salt juice. They are both bulletproof and can do whatever I need at the time  
 Can you share the info that pushed you towards using (Nude's?) nic salt?
Any info you can share would be appreciated.
I've seen a few grumblings about Nude, like their mislabeling of nic concentrations on this sub-reddit's wiki, but I'm skeptical. 
 I started the same way. More and more devices and about 2 years in I just can't be bothered with anything new. I look at it and think about it then just never bother getting anything. What I have works and it's not the hobby it used to be to me. Now it's just a break in my workday and something to do on my drive.  
 Cool, just do it already :)
 Shit, I just changed my mind again. :P 
 Take a hit off a juul. 
I used to say the same thing, till I chain vaped my buds juul and about passed out.  
 I prefer to avoid chain-vaping though, so it sounds like it's exactly the nic delivery system I want. 
 After making my way down to 3mg nic I can see the joy in higher nic juices. Smaller clouds, but better buzz and possibly even flavor. 
 One thing I like about vaping is that regardless of someone's device, tank, & juice preferences, if it's good, it's good. Plenty of times I've assumed that I wouldn't like a certain juice flavor but then I love it. 
 Very true. There are a million variables involved lol.  
 i smoked a pack a day for more than ten years and i've been vaping for about 8 months. i'll smoke a butt every now and then. i don't feel guilty because it just doesn't satisfy anymore in the same way that vaping has. when i would go for lengths of time without smoking before, there was a tremendous anxiety that accompanied it. feeling powerless and having to fight urges constantly is exhausting. not to mention the guilt and shame that would come when you would inevitably give in. the idea, that i can casually smoke a cigarette once every few months, or not at all, and not have to worry about falling right back to where i was, is liberating beyond belief. 
 I have urges to smoke sometimes. This time, I gave it a try. I realized that I didn't miss smoking, and it wasn't as satisfying like before. It felt good, not that I hate smoking, rather I didn't care for it. 
 I smoked for over 30 years, and at least 1/3 of that two packs a day, camel wide lights. 
I'm looking at my 3 year anniversary this weekend. I have zero interest in smoking a cigarette. The idea is pretty much gross to me now. I'm not worried about getting addicted again - I just don't want one! I think about how much better I feel now - my lungs are in great shape now, I breathe better, have more stamina, sleep better, taste and smell better, the idea of losing all that again...not gonna happen.
And, i'm at an age where I still probably have some risk from all of those years lurking, so why take the chance? 
 I hear ya. I?m at ten months myself. Twice in that time I?ve been on a vacation with lots of drinking, and bought a pack of cigarettes each time. I smoked them and I enjoyed them and then I went right back to vaping without a second thought. 
It?s been several months since the last pack, and I fully expect to have another one at some point several months from now. Or maybe not. I don?t know and I don?t care, because in the same time period, I?ve *not* smoked about 200 packs or so.
?Liberating? is a good word for it! 
  You are very lucky, my friend! 
I just know if I bought a pack and smoked them, it wouldn't be very long till I started smoking again. I probably could get away with maybe smoking just or two but now a whole pack. 
I LOVE vaping and everything about it, but I know just how addicting smoking can be and I'm just so very thankful that I was able to break free from it when I did, that I just wouldn't even risk it just for curiosity sake. That's of the biggest reasons I could never really stop smoking before vaping. Even one time where I actually stop smoking for a 3 months, I tried one just because I thought I was over it and could handle just one. Lo and be hold, I was back smoking within a week.
I have no doubt that some people can do what you do though. I just know I'm probably not one of those kind of people and would just be afraid to risk it. But honestly, I'm OK with that as vaping is super satisfying in so many different ways than smoking ever was! 
 > I smoked them and I enjoyed them and then I went right back to vaping without a second thought.
honestly you are in a great spot with that. I mean yeah, cigs are horrid for you, but most things are in varying degrees and IMO there is nothing wrong with enjoying things that are technically bad for you from time to time (I love the german word for things like alcohol, nicotine, candy or whatever, Genussmittel, literally translated somewhere along the lines of stuff for the purpose of enjoyment)
as long as its only from time to time you are fine. not as good as without completely, but FAR better than your old smoking habit. congrats on getting to this place :D 
 I'll have a smoke every couple months and I'll smoke that sucker right down to the filter. I can't lie to myself by saying vaping is more enjoyable because it's not, it's just different.  
 I have a similar story, and I am still kind of beating myself up over it.  I haven't had a cigarette in 3yrs, and the other day I had a huge argument with my gf. I wanted to get high, and say screw it to the last 3yrs of sobriety I have. But, I worked too damn hard to screw that up so I chose to buy a pack of cigarettes. Decided to splurge and buy newport 100's, and $10 later i'm in my car ready to light one up. I felt like I was doing something illegal, my hands were shaking so bad that I could barely light it.       
The taste was nothing like I remembered it. To this day I love the smell of cigarettes when somebody else is having one. But, it tasted horrible when I smoked it. Also kept feeling like I was smoking it wrong since I was used to so much vapor coming out . I ended up giving about 15 away at work, and still have the rest of the pack in my work back-pack. I guess I shouldn't be too hard on myself, considering all the things I have kicked during my life. Cant help but feel like shit though. 
 I don't think it is a bad thing to remind yourself what they taste like. If you didn't enjoy lighting that cigarette, you truly quit smoking. I will put this pack in the freezer so I can remind myself after a year or whenever I have an urge to smoke. I don't that being an issue. After all, this is not heroin we are talking about. 
 I haven't had a cigarette since September 26th of 2014, I get the urge to try one every now and then just to see what it's like. I'm always too scared to try, even though at my worst I was 3 packs a day. 
 I've done this a couple times. After a few months I would try one just to see how it was. Like OP said, its nasty. It literally tastes like you rolled up some dried leaves in paper and lit it up. Nasty as fuck. And the smell. Ick. 
 Today I wanted to try it, to truly see if I really quit smoking or I am lying to myself. I didn't have an urge to smoke after this one. I passed the test. 
 Yeah dude it's nasty once you haven't had one for a while. After having one for shits and giggles every couple months, I have no desire whatsoever to smoke again. 
 Man, I wish that was the case for me. I love how cigs taste, the feel of smoking...only thing I don't care for is the smell afterwards. 
 I used to. It literally tastes like burnt leaves now haha. 
 Several years ago I tried one, a month or so after I started vaping... Just to see.  I got through a few drags, brushed my teeth, used mouthwash and washed my hands with fast orange.  I too seriously questioned how I smoked for so long.
 The worst part about smoking an analog to me is the smell/taste lingers in your nose for so long. Just breathing in an out for a day or so after smoking pisses me off cause I can't shake the smell. 
 Only tobacco I ever indulge in anymore is quality pipe tobacco. Very very occasionally since I don't own any or a pipe, but a guilty pleasure I enjoy with a buddy of mine every couple of months.  
 I didn't have one for almost two years then it snowed in Florida for one night and I smoked a cig. Tasted it for a couple days. The cig I mean.  
 Say what you want about the taste but nothing in vaping has been able to replicate the buzz I get from smoking a fag. Which is also the main reason why I still smoke a few ciggies a week.  
 I vape 3mg. Occasionally I fill up my Kabuki tank with 6mg. 5 hits and I get seriously buzzed. Actually more nic buzz than fast smoked 100 Newport. 
 Even though I stopped smoking completely now and haven't had a cigarette while sober in a long time; I cant help but chain smoke the fuck out of them when I'm drinking. its weird, but its not just me. I noticed many non smokers tend to smoke too when they drink.. Just something about alcohol and newports I guess lol. 
 I bet it tasted like shit.. But oddly satisfying. 
 >It felt like I smoked a bunch of dry leaves from the yard.
I can imagine. 
 Serious question, could you now stop with vaping? Or do you feel addicted? 
 I went 2 weeks without vaping and I didn't lose my mind. I think I could quit if I really wanted to. But flavor is great though... 
 You're talking about the original Dripmod device, the one without a variable wattage chip, right? Not the Dripbox 160 or the new Dripbox 2?
The original Dripbox has low resistance protection (if i'm recalling correctly) and will limit you to 60w, essentially a 3.1V in the case of a .16? coil. Should be fine. It's going to be painfully weak, though. 
 Yeah the original. 
I'm actually using a 2600mAh 40A 3.7 battery with it. 
I tried vaping with that .16 build on it, not weak at all, actually pretty nice, Im just worried if im vaping in an unsafe way on this device, Does it have any safety features? Like, if it fires and actually vapes really nice then I shouldint be conserned because otherwise it wouldint fire?
Thanks alot! 
 It's regulated, don't be too worried. 
 Thanks alot! 
 Does the screen come on for a second when you put the batteries in? 
 It does not no. 
 Man I dont think we csn really help on this one. Seems like it was unfortunately some factory defect. Who did you buy it from? Sounds to me like you will have to work a replacement angle. 
 Does anyone have any idea on how I could fix this problem? 
 Did you update the firmware without the batteries while holding the fire button (the entire length of the update)?
I haven't bothered to update the firmware yet. You can check for a video tutorial and try reflagging the firmware. 
 Yes I did the procedure correctly, without batteries and holding the fire button. It worked for a couple of minutes on the new firmware then just died :/
What does re flagging the firmware mean?
Any chance you could send me the 1.2.1 (or whatever firmware version you're running) Hex file? 
 I'm on mobile so I mean *re-flashing.
I'm on 1.2.1 but you'd be giving me too much credit if you think I know how to get the firmware off the mod and send it. I'm not that tech savvy, sorry :/. Wish I knew how though, I can imagine how you feel atm. 
 haha fair enough. Thanks anyways 
 Could someone send me the 1.2.1 version to see if that will fix my problem? 
 Can you plug it back in via usb and try the firmware update again or is it dead like that too? 
 I can still plug it in and upgrade the firmware. And it says it does it successfully. But it never shows anything on the screen and when I unplug it it still wont turn on.  
 damn, well I guess those were an expensive as fuck 10 puffs 
 It sure was... 
 where is the mod now, has it hit the back shelf yet or is it still out on the table in hopes of repair 
 Seeing as I just got it in the mail less then an hour ago and It is my only current mod. Still out on the table. 
 Try wiping the mod before flashing 1.2.2, if that dosnt work send it back. 
 I Tried the erase all then re-flashing. still did not work 
 Send it back for a replacement 
 [deleted] 
 Because in Version 1.2.2 it fixes the TC problems 
 Well now you have no tc. Ive seen this story way too many times. 
 Thanks for your help. 
 [deleted] 
 So much salt from you, your opinion is just that. Let people do their own thing, man.  
 Just exit the thread if your not trying to help.
Many people have flashed new firmware and have had no problems. I guess you don't update your phone either because it comes proper and technology doesn't change. 
 I dont. 
 Ive had to give a picture of my photo id twice. It doesnt really bother me, they have all my information anyways.  
 I had it happen once, the age verification system didn't like my name (who the hell knows why), sent a photo of my ID and it was no problem.  
 I've only ever had 1 online company need my actual ID scan, and it almost made me just not use them at all. There are other methods to age verify that aren't nearly as stupid. 
 yet we know its not what we are used to doing, 
but the FDA does not mention alternative methods in the regulations.
what we have done is allow someone to block out the DL number.
the only thing we are concerned with is your bill to ship to and DOB   
 Not really.  There are services like veratad but about 30-40% fail that verification method and then what are you left with?  Send in an ID or pay extra for the shipper to age verify on delivery. 
 thank god i'm 29. My drivers license picture looks horrendous. Smile on 3, 1..2...click...fuck, really?
Dumbest shit ever for everyone else. They already have enough age verification protocols/software imo. Why is there some frivolous age limit? So it's ok for a 27 year old, but somehow a 26 year old needs to show I.D? Ugh, they're both fucking adults. I struggle between thinking the FDA is totally corrupt, or totally incompetent.  
 Hey we agree! but we also have to follow all laws or go out of business :(
even though you are 29, for your first time order no one would know. 
 Yea I know, it sucks for everyone (except the fda I guess).  
 The first time I came across that was when I placed an order through some site that I was stupid enough to name, but have since redacted.
I actually emailed them asking if there were any other options, since I didn't feel comfortable sending the image over the internet, and they went ahead and shipped it out without the license image. They told me that the regulations are starting January 2017 or something like that, so maybe online retailers are just getting the systems in place now before they're actually required? I dunno. 
 No, it started in August there's already warnings issued. You should consider not publicly outing a vendor doing you a favor, and remove that name from your comment. 
 Good call. Redacted vendor name. 
 good call on taking other names out,
we do not want to though anyone under the buss 
Here is a link to FDA on regulation dates and ages 
http://www.fda.gov/TobaccoProducts/GuidanceComplianceRegulatoryInformation/ucm514606.htm
right hand column   
 Relatively new to vaping here. All I can say when I see that is what the hell is that thing??? 
 Probably used for hash oil 
 Well thank god for Google. Dry wax. Makes SO much more sense now! Ha!  
 Is that Vaping like a bong??  
 Yes but it's not as cooling as a bong but still very nice  
 There just aren't enough vape bands to prevent me from breaking that thing.  
 This is a time machine  
 Need to set your mod to 88watts... 
 Those LG BTF 1.21 Gigawatt 3000mah batteries are damn hard to find 
 Gotta know some Libyans... 
 Most atmos stuff sucks, is this thing pretty nice? Should I get it? 
 A lot better! I'd recommend it, you to use both dry herb and concentrate. Ceramic for dry herb and titanium oil for concentrate  
 So it's an atmos, what's the model? I vape herb and I've never seen this, pretty cool that it works with herb/wax!  
 Ha, I looked at the atmos site. The atomizer is called [The Studio Rig](http://www.atmosrx.com/Studio-Rig-Attachment-System.html). 
 for dabbing? 
 Dabbing and dry herb.  
 How do you dry herb out of this thing? Genuinely curious 
 god damn! i wish is still smoked erb! this is sweet, if they ever legalise over here im grabing one ASAP 
 While still cool, r/trees would be more fitting. 
 Tobacco use only q:^) 
 Using a device that's supposed to get people of tobacco products for tobacco use is literally the dumbest thing I've heard 
 If it was just the mod in the picture you'd be correct. I'm talking about the entire setup which has a nail for dabbing. I was making a joke referring to how a lot of glass shops display their products. 
Edit: Just realized that's an RDA. I'm referring to the glass attachment in that case. No one using eliquid would use that glass attachment. It's for dabbing concentrates. 
 Right. Exactly why r/trees would be a better fit I feel. 
 There's r/vaporents too. Looks like it's quite active. 
 Don't know why you're getting down voted. I remember the days when shit like this wasn't allowed on vaping subs. Kids these days.  
 This sub moved to r/electronic_cigarette. This post is about vaping m8. 
 I've been looking into one! Let us know how the ceramic works out! 
 where do you actually put your dabs, on the coil? 
 You heat it up and drop it on like a regular nail and then drop the carb cap on top 
 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1__MPUKhZ4I 
 Lmao! 
 OK, so tell me more about this setup. Aty info and a little review? 
 So how does this work? 
 I'm being really naive but can you blaze using a mod? 
 Concentrates, yes. It's a portable rig that comes with a neat little carb cap. It rips like a champ too 
 Is there water in the rig? Doesn't look like enough room for it? 
 Does this work without the glass? Could I attach it to my bong? 
 Mine is all wonky. Set to 400, doesn't get above 325 and take a long time to get there. I thought it was my device, since I never use it. I just keep it in wattage. 
 Nautilus 5ml original tank, Its an MTL (mouth to lung) tank, reasonably priced, low maintenance, reliable. It does produce a surprising amount of vapour for an MTL tank and imo is the best of its kind.
The coils are inexpensive and range from 1.6ohm to 1.8ohm, at that level of resistance you will only fill the tank once or twice a day (you may want a higher nicotine level with your e liquids though). 
 Thanks for the suggestion. Tried one out at the shop tonight. A month ago I would have been all over it but the cleito has spoiled me with airflow and I don't think I could to back.  Contrary to everything I thought I wanted I ended up picking up a Crown 2 lol. I did end up picking up some 0.8 coils though so I should be able to run them on 30-35w 
 If mtl is not your style maybe try supertank by tobecco those 0.2 coils with some fruity juice vapes really well at 30 watts or 35  
 I may pick one up next time. I actually ended up picking up a Crown 2 for my Fuchai 213 and I'm going to keep the Cleito on my RX75 and use it to play around with the RTA until I can get consistent wicking with it. 
 Are you sure you aren't getting clone coils? 
 As far as I know I'm not. I don't buy them online. I go to a local reputable shop to get them. I doubt they'd be selling clones or fakes.  
 I have had the same problem in the past week with two coils, the first one wouldn't screw in properly then when it did it just leaked juice everywhere (should of expected that tbf ?) the second just burnt out in a few hours of steady vaping. Must be a manufacturing problem at Smok. 
 Same here. 5 packs of authentic tfv8 coils and only 1 out of all 5 packs wasn't DOA...  sad because it is an awesome tank! 
 I don't own anything that operates with these coils, so I can't say anything from first-hand experience, but I've seen/heard a lot of people have issues with these coils recently. You're probably not doing anything wrong.  
 Kayfun 5 clone.  Tobeco makes a nice one. 
 For some reason I can't get over the metallic taste from my SJMY. I think it has to be psychosomatic from not washing it properly from the start though.
I'm all about single coil so I have my eye on the new Ammit RTA by Geek Vape which hopefully I can get a deal on Black Friday and then I'll finally retire my OBS Crius. Making and wrapping my own dual coils used to be fun but now it's just a pain especially when I vape at 40 watts or less anyways.
 Where does one get prebuild coils for that?  
 If you're looking for prebuilt RBA sections only popular one I know of is the GeekVape Eagle 
 What about this? 
https://www.fasttech.com/products/3006/10007487/3546501
and I buy these: 
https://www.fasttech.com/products/0/10018139/6007103-thunderhead-creations-staple-kanthal-pre-coiled 
 Go the extra mile and get the TFV8, it comes with a much bigger and better RBA section than the TFV4 styled tank you showed me. I got my TFV8 for under $30, and even the prebuilt coils are impressive. The TFV4 has a small RBA. 
If you're looking for an RTA, go with the Griffin or OBS. Or RDTA, Limitless or Avocado.  
 I don't think buying a gimmick tank with pre-build coil heads that has an RBA section is going the extra mile.  If he's looking for an RBA, there's many out there that are build specifically as RBA.  This way he won't be fighting with the teeny tiny build deck on the TFV8,  or need such a gigantic atomizer on top of his Coolfire IV.  Not to mention that most of the great RBA options he has will cost him half the price of the TFV8.  
 To be fair, me and others on the sub refer as follows. RTA is an RBA tank basically. RDTA is a genny style RDA. RDA is a dripper. RBA is mostly used for the rebuildable section of a tank that takes prebuilts. 
He also showed me a link to the TFV4, which at that point I figured he really wanted a tank with an RBA section. I said go the extra mile and get the TFV8, because the TFV4 RBA is tiny and sucks, I know from experience. The TFV8 is not that small at all actually. I have no idea where you're getting that information. 
If you read my comments, you would see that there was an obvious misunderstanding regarding what he wanted and I did my best to help clarify what he was looking for for both him and others trying to help.  
 Thanks for all your help btw! Really conflicted on what to buy at the moment! 
 It really doesn't matter.  If you're anything like the rest of us, you're going to buy it all eventually anyway... ;) 
 I'm not sure where you get that information
I own one.  The build deck is small, and moreso there's not a lot of room for coils due to the chimney.  I have something like 30 atomizers on the shelf behind me,  I'm a gear whore.  As far as rebuildable tanks go, it's not one I care for.  I'd prefer my Griffin 25s, but again, he's not looking for something that large. 
 What would you advise? 
 Oh okay, that's where we're miscommunication (again). I call tanks like the Griffin an RTA. Smok TFV8 is an RBA, nothing going to change my terminology for them lol. But yes, you're correct. RTA's are made specifically to have a build deck and are usually bigger and/or atleast better than a tank with an RBA section. But compared to tanks that come with an RBA section it's one of the better ones. Again, he/she had used RBA, which I kind of asked about. They then replied with a link to the TFV4, which I figured at that point okay this person is really just looking for a tank with an RBA option.  
 You're getting hung up on semantics, thus the communication errors.  Everything rebuildable is an RBA.  Drippers, tanks, gennies, they're all RBA - Rebuildable Atomizer.  An RTA is an RBA with a tank.  An RDA is an RBA without a tank.  An RDTA is an RDA with a lower tank resevoir, more often called a genesis style RDA or RTA.
A tank with replaceable pre-built coil heads would technically be a rebuildable clearomizer.  That's what most sites use to distinguish them from straight forward RTA decks that require building a coil.  The TFv8 would be a rebuildable clearomizer tank with an optional RBA deck, allowing the use of premade coil heads and also building your own coils.  Note if you head over to fasttech, the TFv8, TFv4, and baby beast are all listed as clearomizers.  This is a better term to distinguish between a tank like the TFv8 and Griffin than misusing the terms RBA and RTA, and less confusing for all.
 Is this the griffin you mean?
https://www.fasttech.com/products/0/10019096/4221200-authentic-geekvape-griffin-rta-rebuildable-tank 
 Almost.
This one has a slightly bigger deck: https://www.fasttech.com/products/0/10019096/5465100-authentic-geekvape-griffin-25-plus-rta
But if you're looking for smaller, then the one you found is 22mm instead of 25mm 
 Bit to big for me to carry around unfortunatly :(  
 Then go with the smaller one, in the other response I listed 4 different tanks. The RTA's have smaller versions, so just look for those on FT 
 They don't have the TFV8 kit on fasttech, its an authentic one to that I showed you, right?
My only issue with the SMOK tanks is that they sip juice like no tomorrow. Any of those other things better with juice consumation?  
 My bad it is an authentic. 
Why do you want to order off of FastTech? 
The Smok prebuilt coils drink juice. From what I've heard, the RBA sections don't consume more than other RBA's/RTA's, the consumption will depend on the build and mass of coil, and of course how big the deck is itself. But the prebuilts are the thirsty ones. 
DIT: Also, the TFV4 even with the RBA won't do much for flavor, flavor is horrendous on that tank. 
 I don't wanna use prebuild coils. Super expensive. What I mean by that are those prebuild wires, I don't want to build those myself. Just wick the cotton. How do those sip more juice then if you build the coil wires urself?
Also, I live in Europe. Buying the RBA deck + TFV8 costs like 50+ euro's here!
Thanks for the help! I really like the Smok baby beast but I'm so concered I'll be burning through juice like a man man. 
 Ah okay, yeah you want either an 
RTA: https://www.fasttech.com/products/0/10019096/5465100-authentic-geekvape-griffin-25-plus-rta
https://www.fasttech.com/products/0/10018376/5464700-authentic-obs-engine-rta-rebuildable-tank-atomizer
or an RDTA:
https://www.fasttech.com/products/0/10021170/5201100-authentic-ijoy-limitless-plus-rdta-rebuildable
https://www.fasttech.com/products/0/10019096/3975000-authentic-geekvape-avocado-rta-rebuildable-tank 
 Which one do you advise the most? (for flavour) 
 It doesn't use anything specific, just buy a pack of prebuilt coils, mount one up, and wick it.  Something like this should work well https://www.fasttech.com/p/4239409 
 Pti RBA clone off fasttech is great on flavor,  small size, doesn't drink juice if you put a nice simple build on it, and looks incredibly sharp.  Cons:  The build deck takes a small amount of getting used to, and the entire positive pin needs to be removed to take off the deck.
The Mage RTA is a great flavor tank,  easy to build on, and small size.  Cons:  Many people have complained they got a unit with a wonky positive pin connection, causing ohms to jump all over the place.  Personally, I received two such units.
The OBS Engine is getting a lot of good attention.  Supposedly leak proof, nice build deck, and great flavor.  Mine is on the way, so I can't comment yet.  However I'm a little suspicious that a tank with top airflow will have flavor to match similar tanks with bottom airflow.  Definitely check out some of the reviews.
Kayfun V5 clone:  Not too expensive, and these are great single coil decks that allow for relatively high resistance builds and restrictive airflow for more of a MTL experience.  If you're looking to get concentrated flavor and save juice and batteries, this might be the direction you want to look in.   
 Obs engine looks very nice! Really cheap to at 20$. What would be the best prebuild coil to buy for those? What material? 
 That's really up to your preference.  If you want to use straight VW mode, it won't hurt to pick up a package of varying pre-built coils of different types.  When I started out I picked up a wheel box of 8 different type of claptons and fancy coils, and two packs of straight plain wire SS coils.  I found out I like using SS coils in temp mode, so I then bought a ton of pre-coiled SS wires in different types.  Finally I gave up on the pre-coiled wires, and just started buying spools of premade clapton wire, alien wire (flat claptons), and plain wire.  Half the fun is playing around and figuring out what you prefer... so definitely try a variety of wires and builds.
 And what about this one?

 Unfortunately I can't buy an OBS engine in europe ... Not with insane long delivery times. My iSub V is currently shitting on me bigtime. I really need an RBA/RTA by the end of the week! 
Is the subtank mini ok for flavour if you rebuild? 
 Atom Metropolis. Takes Kanger coils, so you can purchase the Kanger RBA which is great and fits your description perfectly. 
 Did you dump the tank? 
It's easy to think replacing solely the problem coil will fix your issues, but a burnt atomizer cooking itself next to all your juice is going to have some of that nastiness seep in. 
You might want to twist a paper towel in there too, for good measure.  
 I did dump the tank, but I think I'll do it once more and get it really clean like you said. 
 Have you primed the coil as well as let it sit for a good 10 min before use? 
 Yup, did that too. 
 Yeah those icare coils really need to be primed or else you will get a terrible tasting vape. 
 Just be thankful you're in an airport that has a smoking section at all.  
 Pretty much this.
I don't think I've seen a single designated smoking area where I live in Canada in about a decade.
Robin's Doughnuts once had a separate room for smoking, but I'm pretty sure legislation shut that shit down hard, if not then the owners did. I haven't been there in forever though, so feel free to correct me on this. 
 For real. I was flying home to Georgia (Heartsfield Int.) from Michigan (Detroit Int.) about a month ago and my flight got delayed a total of 5 hours. Detroit int. has no smoking section nor allows vaping inside any part of the building. I don't dispute the rule, it makes some sense after all, but man was that one hell of an unexpected nuisance. Staring at planes taking off and landing just isn't enough of a distraction and I wasn't about to be groped again at security just so I could vape. 
 Oh I am. Some places actually allow you to vape in the terminal which is pretty cool. Wish more airports would look into that.  
 Wait what?  You can smoke, but you can't vape? 
 You can vape in the smoking room. Just sucks having to smell like a cigarette.  
 Oh!  I see!  I was gonna say....that would be insane 
 Sounds like he can vape, but only where there's smoking.
Personally I'm fine with this when the alternative is no vaping. 
 Exactly. Most of us used to smoke cigarettes anyway. Yeah it's shit but it's better than nothing. 
 I'm happy there's somewhere to vape. Just wish I could use it in the terminal. Some airports allow it but not where I'm at.  
 I have seen people vape right out in the middle of the terminal at LAX and O'Hare.
I don't condone that as I think it's kind of a douchey move personally.
I usually tuck into the bathroom and for few stealth hits. 
 All part and parcel of being a grown adult. One day you will learn that things don't always go your way. 
 Atlanta or Denver? 
 The fuck?  
 Those are the only two airports in the USA where there are smoker's lounge.  I think Charlotte had one up until recently, but not 100% on that.  You from outside the US?  Otherwise there is a secret smoking airport no one knows about in the US lol. 
 Salt Lake City had one last time I went through - I always think it's funny because Mormons  
 Haha for real? Yeah I'm flying from Denver to Atlanta! Now I feel lucky as fuck lol 
 Atlanta and lucky are two things I didn't expect to hear in the same sentence.  Heck, I'l take a 4 hour layover *anywhere* if it means I don't have to go through ATL lol.  I've heard it's actually gotten better but I don't really know if I'm all that curious. 
 Exactly.  
 Original Delta hubs have always had smoking sections -- Atlanta, Cincinnati and Salt Lake City, and they still do.  I'll be using CVG and SLC Wednesday when my wife and I fly to Vegas.  Additionally there is Denver as mentioned, and I believe Tampa still has one that is partially outside, but past security.  Finally, Vegas should still have smoking areas (of course with a handful of slot machines crammed in there too).
There aren't many in the US -- when I was a smoker I tried to always go through those few airports that had them, Atlanta most often. 
 Flew through SLC and Dallas luckily on my last trip to LA. Was super happy to be able to vape, whether or not people were allowed to smoke as well. Really helps in between hours of flying!  
 Them's the breaks.  I spent about half of my week in the airport last week unexpectedly.  On a positive note, at least you're conserving juice for a bit. 
 You can vape in Heathrow apparently. 
Schipol has these little smokers pods that you can use, but they are horrendous. Filled with horrible stale tobacco smoke.  
 You can no longer vape in Heathrow. They allowed it for a while but now it's banned again. You can vape in the semi outdoor smoking areas at Manchester and Leeds-Bradford though.
Edit: forgot to mention that there is an outdoor area where you can smoke/vape at both Copenhagen and Barcelona airports.  
 Need a stealth vape, I carry my JUUL for times like that.  
 It sucks we can't exclude ourselves from the cigarette smoke (it's funny cause when we are forced to go to the smoking areas, we are forced to put in our lungs exactly what we are avoiding with vaping). But American airports are garbage in general. I hate flying. The couple times I've been out of country (London, Spain), the airports are 1000 times better than ours. It's embarrassing. 
 Man it must suck to be you. Having to get your nicotine fix in a room full of people doing the same thing in a manner that you used to. All while you are waiting to board a metal box that will literally fly through the sky. 
 How is that even relevant? Yeah we all need a nicotine fix but there's a difference between cigarette smoke and vapor. I'm glad you know what a plane is made of though.  
 I found this last sentence hilarious 
 just go to the mens and toot in a stall.... 
 This 
 Last time I did that airport security followed me around. Went into an area where nobody was at but I'm sure it looked sketchy. Learned my lesson either way so I don't recommend it.  
 No, please. I don't want to smell your watermelon or custard fog while I'm taking a dump right beside you. 
 ok I forgot to say don't do it if others are around you....
but really, isn't it better than smelling other peoples crap? 
 My first was the Innokin Cortex followed by the Cool Fire 4 Plus. Im not sure where you live (im in australia, so i cant speak on prices) but you cant go wrong with Innokin. I'd buy the Cool Fire TC 100 or the Cool Fire 4 Plus. Brilliant mods and Innokin have a great track-record with safety. They have an internal battery so you dont have to buy a charger and batteries. However, having an internal battery also means that the mod will last you about 6-8 months before the battery isnt able to hold a decent charge. At this point you'll have to buy another mod. Seeing as this is your first mod, I would recommend that you DONT buy dual-battery mods. I also dont recommend that you buy from Chinese stores such as gearbest, fasttech etc. Buy something locally. Cheers 
 Most dual 18650 mods are within your price range and should have all the power you'd need (150 to 200w), but don't forget, you need to add in for 2-4 batteries (depending if you want an extra set or not), and an external charger to charge them properly.
Look up the thread on the ilumn battery sale, lg hg2 are $4 each right now I think, or Sony vtc5a for $6 I think. Chargers on sale too. Maybe for the mod, wait until the black Friday sales start to go live, should be able to get a good deal. Smok alien, cuboid, sigelei fuchai 213, or the releaux line by wismec are all good choices I think. I just picked up the smoant battlestar from GearBest for $36, I think I'll be happy with it, just gotta wait for it to get here
I'll leave you to do your own research on the mods, watch some reviews and pick what suits ya. They all have their own pros and cons 
 I looked up that Battlestar and it looks great, I've been doing nothing but researching so far today. It looks like that mod you mentioned has a USB charging port, so I'd spend another 15-ish on batteries for it and I'd be set? 
 Yeah, I'm pretty pumped about trying it out for myself, I think it's gonna be a good mod, especially for the price. 
As the other replier said, it is generally not a good practice to charge over USB, as the device does not guarantee a balanced charge between the two cells, which can cause uneven degradation of the batteries, and decreased performance over time 
 most dual battery mods require an external charger as the batteries won't charge properly through USB. 
 You can tell your buddy to keep the tank and get a [Nebox] (https://vaping.com/nebox) for $20. It uses a single [18650] (http://www.illumn.com/18650-lg-18650g2-3000mah-high-discharge-flat-top.html) which is $5. The nebox has a 10ml tank built into it. You can watch some youtube reviews on it. Then head over to [Swagg Sauce] (https://www.swaggsauce.com) and get some affordable ejuice for $10 or however much you wanna spend. That's $35 before shipping.  
 The Nebox is a great mod, I own and use one for traveling until now, however, I wouldn't really recommend this mod because of the tank. The tank on this just held me up on so much good juices because it would crack. 
 Since it's your first mod you could get a sigelei j150. It has an internal battery so you don't need to worry about batteries just yet! It also comes with a silicone protector sleeve! 
 I'll put this as a separate comment. You can get the [IPV5 200w TC] (https://breazy.com/products/ipv-5-200w-tc-box-mod-pioneer4you?utm_source=Breazy&utm_campaign=844e9d7e1a-EMAIL_CAMPAIGN_2016_11_14&utm_medium=email&utm_term=0_35e3f34f25-844e9d7e1a-323420089&mc_cid=844e9d7e1a&mc_eid=3c1f9520f9) for $35 with coupon code Countdown and 2 [LG HG2's] (http://www.illumn.com/18650-lg-18650g2-3000mah-high-discharge-flat-top.html) for $10. Thats $45. Then get a 60ml bottle of [Naked100] (https://breazy.com/collections/naked-100-e-liquid?utm_source=Breazy&utm_campaign=844e9d7e1a-EMAIL_CAMPAIGN_2016_11_14&utm_medium=email&utm_term=0_35e3f34f25-844e9d7e1a-323420089&mc_cid=844e9d7e1a&mc_eid=3c1f9520f9) for $12 with the same coupon code. Thats $57 before shipping.  
 Looks like .2 ohm is as low as it will fire. Also make sure you are using a quality 18650 battery if you build this low. 
 Different types of smoke detectors react differently to vapor. 
 Good to know. Guess it's time to read up on how smoke detectors work 
 Smoke detectors work on detecting a sudden influx of particles in the air so I imagine what happened was, as the vapour has rushed out of your room it's created a sudden influx in the amount of particles in the air setting of the detector. It happens all the time for me with the smoke detector outside my room.
 
 from what I remember (no smoke detectors anywhere here in germany) some use an IR laser that when broken by smoke or similar things (anything that can obscure it) gets set off, others react to heat 
 People don't use smoke detectors in Germany?  
 in some places I guess, but I have yet to see them in someones house or appartment.
no clue why, maybe due to the higher amount of wooden buildings in parts of the US so the fire risk is higher? barely any wood in the contruction unless you have wooden floors, and even then tiles are the most common (sometimes covered with that weird plastic floor thing) 
 It's got more to do with regulations being enforced or not. For can happen, wooden house or not. Everything burns 
 huh been looking into it, seems we recently got these regulations, but in my state the building owner has until 2020 to add them, by then every house and appartment needs one
guess I need to make sure I get one that isnt tripped off by my vape when it comes to it 
 I've set off one of those fancy smoke detector systems before with a fog machine. The kind that call the fire department. 
It was awkward. 
 Go on with the story! It's gotta be a good one. Halloween party or something? 
 Us youngsters were on vacation one time. We decided to rent a fog machine for the week for some reason. 
We had fun fogging up the house, bathrooms, you name it. One night, we got the bright idea to leave it in a room and tape the button down to see just how thick we could make the fog. We go to open the door and all the fog pours out, right on to a smoke detector.
Sirens start blaring and we're messing with the keypad trying to figure out the code to shut the thing off. 
Next this we know a bunch of firemen show up to a house full a smoke and a bunch of kids apologizing profusely.
It was not fun explaining to our parents why there were firetrucks in the driveway when they got home. 
 Yes, vapor will set off most home-grade smoke detectors, as will steam from your shower. 
 Came to say this. I like to take boiling hot showers. The shower I use when I visit my parents literally has a smoke detector right outside the bathroom door. I've set it off countless times. 
 Yup. My detectors are annoying. Drying clothes and hot showers will sometimes set them off...my dishwasher did once, also. 
 It looks like smoke. Most smoke alarms have a visual sensor, and vapor doesn't like the other vapor you're talking about, steam. 
 No, no they don't. Only huge commercial buildings (like auditoriums, concert halls, etc) use smoke detectors that have use photoelectric or optical smoke detection methods, and they're extremely uncommon. Households almost never use this type. Don't talk about things you don't know.  
 Photo-voltaic smoke detectors are the simplest and cheapest form. Why would these not be common?  
 I work in multifamily housing and install smoke detectors of that style all the time.  And they're commonly available at home depot/Lowes for anyone to purchase and install.  
 The ones in my apartment have it.  
 My smoke detectors in my home are this style. 
>Don't talk about things you don't know.
You might want to take your own advice. 
 If its laser it'll go off. I vape in my office at work and had to read up on different kinds of detectors/sprinkler heads to make sure I wasn't gunna get myself fired or soaked.  
 Wow what random timing for this post, I set mine off last night as well. I have vaped with it in the same room for months now and randomly yesterday was the day.  
 I always set mine off, drives my wife crazy, she told me to only vape in my living room with the window open from now on.... nowhere else inside  
 It might set off the ionizing radiation type you have in your home. I've done it. Next time you set one off, just poke the test button. Most smoke detectors will actually reduce sensitivity for a few minutes once you silence them. Handy when you're cooking.
It will *definitely* set off the photoelectic type in commercial installs. Too much dust in the air will trigger those bastards.
I test the ones at a rescue I do maintenance for by putting the system in walk-through mode and blowing clouds at them. The detector lights up red when triggered, and you confirm each alarm was received at the fire panel. 
 I've done that a few times. Opening a window, having an air purifier and a fan stopped that from happening. But now it's too cold to use a fan or open a window. ? 
 Yeah, its a thing that happens.
A lot. 
 Dont even get me started on setting off fire alarms. I was house-sitting for my neighbor and they have a central alarm system and fire alarm thats wired throughout the house. On the Friday night that i was staying there....with my gf (who of course wasn't supposed to be there) we were vaping on non cloudy gear (subox mini and ipv4s/goblin mini, 15 months ago) and all of a sudden the fire alarm/central alarm went off through out the whole house! I ran downstairs and punched in the alarm code which shut off the central alarm but not the fire detector in the room we set it off in. The alarm company called the house and i explained to them whats going on as the fuckin fire alarm is blaring at 1am. The damn thing just wouldnt shut off and keep in mind its hard wired throughout the house...no batteries. Well long story short after 10 minutes i snipped the fuckin wire and that was that. I told the company to come on Monday to rewire it which they did. The good thing is the fire alarms still worked in the rest of the house just the one in that room didnt with the cut wire which i assume they fixed.  
 I've set mine off in my dorm room like 5 times in the past few months. Some smoke detectors are heat-based, and some detect for particles in the air (the latter is the kind in my dorm apparently) 
 Any smoke detector I've ever blown a cloud at went off.  First time it ever happened to me was in a hotel.  It's easy to do.   
 I set off smoke alarms even sanding walls vaping can def set off a photoelectric or whatever they are called smoke alarm. 
 I hadn't set mine off in my new townhouse until a few weeks ago. That is when I discovered that they are photo-voltaic, all wired together so they all go off and you have to reset the originating one to get it to stop, and that it is not just an annoying sound but an oddly calm woman saying Fire, Fire, Fire, Fire, Fire
That was fun.  
 happens to me too - think the detectors are picking up the vapour that's produced. They occasionally get set off when I'm cooking too, with the steam etc.  
 Istick pico and a clieto. Definitely a solid set up. Not a kit but it seems to be what you're looking for. 
 Thanks I will check those out! 
 How did you wick it? 
 with LOTS of tucking and a layer wrapped around the coils 
 Pix of the wicking? And how does it vape? 
 Mod: RX200S 
Atomizer: TFV8
8 wrap 24g SS316L around two 3.5mm bits 
 Could you please show the wicking? 
 **Please remember to give us some details about your coil shot, like this**

**This is not mandatory, but it goes a long way in improving the content in the sub. Thanks!**
*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically. Please [contact the moderators of this subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Vaping) if you have any questions or concerns.* 
 How would you even go around wicking it ?? 
 I thought the tfv8 was a sub ohm tank?  
 It is! I'm using the RBA that came with it. My build clocks in at 0.3 ohms, so I'm definitely subohming  
 It comes with a rebuildable rba section as well.  
 How far down do your wicks go? I initially thought they should dip to the bottom of the tank, but found out the best way is to have them go BARELY into the glass part. When the tank is filled with juice, you shouldn't see the wicks from the side, it should look like just juice. 
 
 Have you tried pushing the cotton over in each channel leaving a small gap? 
 This. Having a small gap in the wicking holes seems to help the wicking process. I just use the thinnest screwdriver in my coil kit. 
Also, as others said, the wicks should go just past the top of your juice well. You shouldn't be able to see them through the glass of your tank.  
 You only need to have a gap in one hole. I just use a little screwdriver to push one to the side.  
 Fair enough, I've heard of people doing both. Whatever works for you is the way to go. 
 For sure, when mine was in the mail i watched and read a ton of reviews and they all said to have gaps in each hole. But really you just need on so air can get in and equalize the pressure. Having only one hole makes it almost impossible for it to leak too.  
 All of these are right. 
You don't have to Scottish roll and pack as much cotton into a coil as you can with an rdta. Make sure you can tug the cotton back and forth between the coils with limited resistance. When tugging at on side it should move the mod, however.
Cut the wicks below the deck and put holes in each juice well. Never had a dry hit or muted flavor with my limitless plus or combo. 
 your cotton might be too tight in the holes, preventing it from flowing up past that point
I like to have it barely in the holes on my limitless plus and just tilt my vape while taking a hit or holding it upside down for a few seconds to redrip 
 this is how I use it. plus I thin out the tails with some elbow tweezers. 
try a bit less cotton, OP.
 
 Triade 250 owner checking in! Went from various mechs to an old school sig 150, to a custom 2200mah lipo DNA200 box to the Triade. Out of all of my mods the Triade is hands down the best mod I've ever owned. The quality of the mod, small size and fit in your hand is just incredible, not to mention insane battery life with 3x LG HG2 batteries.
As far as why you'd want a DNA chip over something like an RX chip is because with a DNA what power you dial in is what you get. It's the most accurate and consistent chip on the market. Secondly and probably most importantly is the use of the E-scribe software for insane temperature control functionality. You can use ANY temp control wire and monitor the temp control accuracy in real time.
Basically there are no limits with a DNA chip, it is a vaping end game chip.
Curently running dual fused 26g 3mm nife52 claptons (40g kanthal wraps) @ 0.11ohms and the temp control sticks like glue to the set temp. The chip hits the coils with as much power as needed and then backs off into the draw so that you get a constant 430f for the entire draw. 
 The point of the DNA chip is that it gives you control over every aspect of your device. You have the ability to monitor graphs in real time on your PC to determine things like battery problems. You can customise everything.
Apart from the immense customization options, it also provides the BEST Temperature control system of any mod available on the market. It allows you to import wires that otherwise wouldn't be available, allowing you to import more than just Stainless Steel 316. It allows you to import a SS 316 fused clapton 26/36, as an example.
If you don't use TC, or want to monitor your device on your PC. It's not for you. 
 Every feature EXCEPT adjusting ohms  
 Why would you ever want to adjust your ohms?
If you find your ohms jumping around, then you have a build problem. Unlike cheap Chinese chips, you should not lock ohms on a DNA board, or a Yihi board. 
 Do you check your build with an ohm reader?
Why would you do that if your device does that itself? 
 
 Yes, I build and pulse on my ohm reader. Just for a general reading.
It's just there, once it's on my mod, bedded in, and in use, the ohms will change on any coil. 
There, I answered two of your questions, so why would you want to adjust your ohms on the mod? 
 Um.. There is a manual resistance input. 
 Really? I have not found this  
 It's under the atomizer analyzer on the first tab of eScribe. I think it's called override ohms. That's one of the downsides of the DNA chip though, you need a PC to really utilize some of its features. 
 Honestly man it's a fantastic chip with tons of features but if you don't know what it does or the difference, you probably won't notice much and don't need to spend the extra money  
 What are your most used features of the chip then? I keep seeing everything about the features of them, I just can't seem to find more info. -_- 
 What are your most used features of the chip then? I keep seeing everything about the features of them, I just can't seem to find more info. -_- 
 f.e. you can create a chart (map) for your batteries to work longer. Or you can set up a profiles for your tc settings. (Tc works beeter on dna as far as i know). 
 I only use mods with proven chipsets , YiHi or Evolve DNA's for the sole reason of knowing they are top quality chipsets .
I never used or cared what exact features they offered , i use them because they are exceptionally reliable .
I have never had a mod fail in years & they are used all day everyday. 
 Get it!! I bought one of these when they launched, and have never been happier, I don't think I will be buying a new mod for quite some time. 
 > if anyone has any experience with the lost vape triade 250, I'd love to hear your experiences.
I have the DNA200 version. The paint literally started falling off after about a month. And I'm not the only one who ran into this:
 - https://www.reddit.com/r/electronic_cigarette/comments/5cmxkq/has_anyone_done_a_teardown_of_the_lost_vape_triade/
No idea if they have fixed that with the new DNA250.
As /u/Gushluva already pointed out, the DNA chip is mostly geared towards temp control (TC) and you can customize the chip via their software (Escibe - PC only).
You can find some more info on the Evolv website:
 - https://www.evolvapor.com/
Escribe software:
 - https://evolvapor.forumchitchat.com/post/escribe-software-download-and-tutorial-7488045 
 In simple terms. If you are into temperature control, then the dna chip is what you want. 
If you don't want to get into temperature control, then I see no reason to get one 
 > If you don't want to get into temperature control, then I see no reason to get one
The DNA board also gives the most consistent, accurate, smoothest VW experience one can get. It's not *just* for temp control. 
 Agreed. Switching back and forth between my DNA200 and any other non-DNA device, I can tell a substantial difference in vape quality in VW mode. The only thing I have that comes close are my YiHi devices, and the DNA beats them out as well. I'd say the evolv boards and the YiHi boards are the top two rungs on the vape ladder, with the DNA being the top rung. 
 I bought the Lost Vape Triade DNA 200 close to 3 weeks ago. I couldnt wait for the DNA 250 to arrive to Australia. I had just purchased the RX200s and it was utter garbage, I needed a quick 3-battery replacement so i went with Lost Vape. The Triade definitely has a made in china feel. The DNA chip is pretty good, it wasn't the life-changing experience that I thought it would be. In saying that, I dont use temperature-control. In variable-wattage, the triade performs better than my fuchai 213 but not significantly better than the rx200s. The rx200s has horrible heat-dissipation while the triade's heat-dissipation is quite good. Both become hot with low-ohm builds and high wattages but the rx200s gets ridiculously hot (faceplate/chipset area), even at lower wattages and higher resistances. Overall, the triade's quite a decent mod and the DNA is quite a decent chip. All the best. 
 I hate to sound like a snob but once you vape (well setup and in a rebuildable, prebuilt TC coils suck) TC on a DNA you won't want to vape anything else. I own five for a reason. Even my SO refuses to use TC on anything else (Ti on all my atomizers).
Power mode you won't notice much of a difference but you will be able to run higher power to lower pack voltage due to high efficiency. 
 Get the Rx200s. One the best mods I've owned. Many people have preferred the Rx board over the 200. Don't get me wrong, the 200 is the gold standard currently. Considering the price point Rx200s is beyond amazing. The triple 18650 last me 2 and half days on light vaping and a good 30 hours of constant vaping.  
 I bought the dna250 and the dna75 squanker, and the dna75 been good the 250 auto fired and blew the chip . 
 Don't buy batteries from Amazon, too many counterfeits and no way of checking to make sure they're authentic 
 Never buy batteries on Amazon. There's a good chance they can be fakes, which can be very dangerous.  
 Since you are limited to just buying with an amazon gift card...this is one place I know that utilizes Amazon payments.
They carry LG HG2's which are a great battery and will work great with your mod.

 45 mg nicotine? Am I reading this right? Wow. How are you breathing, lol. 
 Yes 45mg! I quit smoking for 8 months now but I still need my quick fix ?? 
 Just wondering how much have you smoked previously? I was a pack of red malboros a day guy, and 12mg is highest I can go. 
 Smoked for a 8 years and about a pack a day sometimes half and on weekends like 5 packs and I switched from sorts of different brand cigs. Mainly always smoked Marlboro lights and switched a lot to newports lol  
 If I had 45mg nicotine I think my lungs would instantly evaporate  
 It's not too bad with this. I think I might of lost one of my lungs tho. Who knows ? 
 Is it 45mg or 4.5mg? Cause my brain is melting trying to imagine 45mg of nicotine 
 No its 45! Don't let your brain fool you. It's a salt based liquid tho, so it's actually less harsh then your normal 24mg of nicotine with VG and PG.  
 Wasn't aware any existed. Sweet! 
 TvF8 T10 coil. Rangw of 50w-300w with a best range of 130w-190w. 
 No but I need some new ones so I'll give these a try for sure 
 I actually saw a video on Facebook a local B&M shop posted showing off the cloud production at 300 watts on this coil. 
 What? Where'd you get this! Been looking quite literally EVERYWHERE for this coil. Could NOT find it... 
 https://www.elementvape.com/smok-tfv8-turbo-engines-replacement-coils i think this is it v8 t10. 
 Not available on there yet. 
 Local b&m 
 SHUT UP AND TAKE MY MONEY!!!!!!!! 
 Where. Did. You. Buy. These..... 
 Local b&m 
 Please I've been looking all over 
 Wow, not yet. Me gusto! 
 Where the hell did you find this,  and does it burn in 2 days like the rest of the TFV8 coils?  
 I've had it in the coil for the last 2 days. Ran it hard last night. 190w still no issues. 
The thing is I don't let my juice get below the side holes. At all.. 
 I've been using the TFv8 for about 4 months now and I've only had to buy coils once. I think you may be doing something wrong. 
 I must be,  but I'm not sure what it'd be.  I'm running them within their wattage and not letting them go dry,  yet the longest any coil has lasted me is just a little over a week.  
 Does it taste like burnt cotton? I've found when I put in a new coil I do it right before bed so it can sit and wick over night. These coils are huge and take some time to wick. You might be burning them out early and it's making them seem like they're not lasting anywhere near as long.
Edit: They obviously don't need to wick for 8 hours but I can't breath without my vape in my hand. 
 It's odd.  It doesn't quite taste burned.  Just dry and flavorless.  
 Might be your juice. Have you tried it on other mods? Also is it sweetener heavy juice? That stuff gums up coils FAST. 
 I learned my lesson with sweeteners and coils with my Loaded Smores. Never again.  I've been vaping Strawberry @70/30 and 3mg nic. 
When I change juice,  I vape the tank empty,  but not dry,  put new juice in, suck on it a few times to get the juice in the coil and start vaping. 
New coils get the same treatment,  except I always drip a but of juice down in the coil itself (I use the T8, so I don't have to saturate the cotton outside), suck on it a bit and vape away.  
 Huh Idk man. I've been vaping on this for quite a while and coils typically last me about a month and a half. I actually only change coils when I get a flavor that stains the cotton. (Can't taste anything else no matter how many juices I cycle through.)
 
 I've had that happen once... They seem to burn or lose flavor around day 2. Maybe I just have a lemon atty.  Idk.  I'm just fed up with this thing,  and SMOK in general.

 Best way is to get a copy of the purchase receipt. Usually pretty easy to procure if you buy something online and use an email address.  
 This is all coming from heavily misinterpreted changes last week. All they did was basically say, no we can't tell you to go fuck yourself because you wrote down something wrong on your application. 
 Another post trying to clear confusion when they themselves don't understand it.  You wouldn't lose your 300k fee to the FDA because it doesn't exist.  The cost is in you putting the application together, there is no fee to submit it.  
The FDA tried to implement a process for rejecting applications without going through the formal rulemaking process.  They defended that it was for applications not in English or not even about a tobacco product (clearly invalid) but anybody who has started dealing with them (or altria who had been for years) knows they'd just as easily use that process to reject a perfectly valid application the day before it's due to remain compliant, making you non compliant because we're FDA and fuck you. 
 Thanks for staying on top of this. 
 Clickbait. 
 OP, it's fine to use the USB to charge this device. The two 18650's are in parallel which means they can never become unbalanced. I haven't tested the TC100W yet but I have tested the iStick Pico and the TC40W. Both have a simple charge circuit which have an ideal maximum charge voltage and current. I would put money on the TC100W being the same. The only thing I'd recommend is not leaving it plugged in for an extended time. Overnight is fine. Excuse me if I go on rants replying to the other comments saying it's bad ;) 
 Get an external, it's better anyway. 
 It is bad for the batteries. You should buy a charger 
 Stop fear mongering. The istick is a single 18650 mod (edit: dual with balanced charging), its perfectly fine to charge via usb to the mod. In fact its perfectly fine on a dual battery mod as long as the mod has balanced charging. Just slow.
Yes its preferable to have an external charger for numerous reasons, but most new vapors dont start out with one, and convienence not withstanding, thats perfectly fine.  He's not going to hurt anything.
 
 Mine is a dual 18650, thanks 
 Yup. Agreed. The fear mongering is getting fuckin ridiculous. Can i build .25ohms in my tfv8 rba on my alien with 2 lg hg2s and not blow my face off? 
 Wow. Well said all but the fact that since the mod runs on 2 batteries and not one like you said it is almost universally agreed that charging in the device is not ideal. 
And expressing what is safer is fact not fear mongering. I'm not saying it's going to blow up just that it's not good for the battery 
 100w istick is 2 batteries 
 Ah your right was thinking the pico, but it does have balanced charging, so again perfectly fine. Just slow as fuck. 
 Eleaf doesn't have a good track record for charging more than one battery, even in parallel. Anyone remember when this sub was filled with pictures of istick 50 watt mods that had blown up due to it's so called charging? 
I don't usually trust charging more than one battery on series devices unless it's a DNA board, but I don't trust eleaf at all to charge more than one battery regardless of whether it is series or parallel.  
 Eleaf has had a history of problems charging within the mod. The only one with a removable battery that seems okay is the Pico. 
In the interest of safety over the long term, an external charger would be preferable. In a pinch, though, USB can be used if watched carefully. 
 I really doubt an Istick has balanced charging, my girlfriend has the 200w, says balanced charging but it definitely isn't.  
 The TC100W has the cells in parallel so it doesn't need to balance charge. 
 Explain this to all of us how hour sure it's bad for his batteries.
 Eleaf doesn't have a good track record. Remember the istick 50 watt? How this sub was literally filled with people complaining that their istick 50 watt blew up when charging it? It was a dual battery device. In parallel even which is safer/easier to charge than series. I don't trust eleaf for charging more than one battery at all.  
 Ya its fine but not ideal.

http://www.illumn.com/nitecore-intellicharge-i2.html 
 i just make sure that my cotton covers the holes completely. Never had any issues :) 
 In the holes but not flush against the bottom. You want a few mm for the juice to flow freely into your wicks. Ive had this thing for a week and by wicking that way I haven't had a leak yet.  
 So probably have cotton down to the end of the holes, but not actually touching the bottom eh? For some reason I figured having the tails touching the bottom would be the most efficient way for it to wick, but I guess not! 
 Either way works fine honestly. I think the most important thing though is to thin your tails before stuffing them in so that it doesn't constrict in the holes after expansion from the juice. 
 That's pretty much it. It's a very forgiving tank. 
 I cant name any off the top of my head that are Musk based like a colonge and i couldnt imagine it tasting very good lol  
 My go to is vapergate's MFPB. Savoury peanut butter  
 Clove! Still a little sweet, but even tobacco flavors taste a little sweet to me 
 Almost all the flavorings are artificial and vegetable glycerine is sweet by itself. Hence all the fruity and dessert flavors. Personally, I'm with you. The scent stays. I smell like cheap vanilla perfume a lot. Better and lighter than cigarettes but still id kill for a smoke flavor. Like campfire flavor. 
 The Shocker by Cosmic Fog. Bitter and Good at the same time.  
 Also Kryptonite by Cosmic Fog. Perfumish but not sweet at all.  
 Currios From The milk man is this non sweet cinnamon taste really love it.
 [Real Extracts](https://real-tobacco-extract.com) mostly does tobaccos and never adds sweetener. They are not sweet but are quite pleasant natural extracted flavors. The pecan and black walnut tobaccos I would consider to be drier and not sweet. 
 [This](http://www.steam-engine.org/coil.asp) should help!
Edit: Use the core wire for your input. The wrap doesn't affect the resistance much.  
 whenever you try to share steam engine it doesn't carry over the data you filled in. I feel pretty dumb now but I never noticed the wire wizard page before. it definitely gave me some insight. 
 Ah i was just linking you to the page :) Hopefully it will give you a general idea where to start and you can go from there.  
 Spaced coils are hands down my favorite.   Flavor is fine and wicks last so much longer.  I've tried macro, twisted, Clapton and every other random combination out there but spaced are truly the best.  
 I don't know why but, I get the opposite. If I space my coils I get a muted flavor. 
 does it work with fused clapton? 
 Yes 
 based on a recommendation i got in [the thread i submitted yesterday](https://www.reddit.com/r/electronic_cigarette/comments/5dvdf4/whats_your_favorite_single_coil_rta_build/), today i tried a single spaced 24g Kanthal coil in my Serpent Mini, probably like 5/6 wraps coming in at .46 ohms and i can't believe the flavor i'm getting at 22 watts. i like it so much better than the twisted 26g contact coil i had in yesterday.
EDIT: i also found this building method to be the easiest and fastest without any additional tools, screws, or trying to wrap parallels and separating them - https://youtu.be/0-4G8J0yZMY?t=1m54s 
 I feel like a twisted 26 spaced coil will make you nut 
 Have you tried fused claptons in the serpent mini? I just got one and threw in a fused clapton, 5 wraps. Im not getting alot of flavor. Wondering if spaced fused works. Might give it a shot. Happen to know why spaced gives more flavor? 
 It's crazy how much of a difference it makes 
 Yup. We old timers (well at least this one) been doing them spaced for years. Only time I don't is when I'm space limited.  
 regular coils or fused clapton spaced? 
 I'll space anything except fused claptons. Single core claptons I also space.  
 Why won't you space fused Clapton's? 
 Usually because of space. To be honest I don't use them often since I only vape in the 60-70 watt range.  
 Oh ok lol the way it sounded in my head, it sounded like you had some sac religious reason not to haha space makes way more sense  
 I played around a bit and it didn't seem to make a big difference on my rdas but man did my rebuildables tanks get a huge boost 
 Spaces are better in every way. Plus you don't need to dry fire them. Spaced coils done right wont require scraping/squeezing or any of that . 
 so no point on doing spaced on an rda? 
 It depends on too many factors. Best thing would be to just give it a shot and see what happens. 
 On my tobeco velocity mini spaced Clapton's reduced flavor like crazy. YMMV depending on your setup. 
 Smelly Rabbit, Tricks are for Kids! ;P Thanks for the advice! It does help.  
 I never used spaced wires on any of my builds I normally pinch together my claptons or just straight 24 gauge. 
I got the vgod trick tank pro with bottom airflow  last week and I decided to build by using spaced claptons (26 +32) and oh my lord I wished I did this sooner the flavour is the best I have ever had on any build or tank. I think the bottom airflow helps but most of the credit has to go to the spaced clapton.
Another thing I like about spaced wires is there are no hotspots.  
 It also lets you up your watts, as the increased wick area allows a much larger heat capacity. My straight 22g kanthal build (8 spaced wrap on 3.5mm), handles more wattage than my previous alien (3x26/38) build. 
 I could be wrong, but I think your sciencing is off friend. 
 How so? The wick is making the vapor, and a spaced build adds a huge amount of wick area. But my sciencing doesnt change that my 5 wrap alien could only handle about 175 watts, and my spaced kanthal build will handle about 220. 
 ...the wick makes the vapor..?
I was wrong, your science isn't off. Its nonexistent. Please never get an unregulated mod.
Ever. Just never do it, please. 
 Are you dense? I'm telling you how it reall works the juice is vaporized off the wick. A spaced build exposed a bunch more wick. The wick barrel inside the coil is what is heating, right? Otherwise, where did the juice come from?  
 Ignoring why spaced builds work differently is the opposite of scientific. In my going on 4 years with rebuildables, I have likely experimented more than you ever have. If you have access to a laser thermometer, you can invesigate this yourself.  
 I also have four years experience. You literally said the wick makes the vapor. That is more incorrect than anything I've ever heard. Yes, the wick delivers the juice to the coil that vaporizes it. The wick does not make the vapor by any stretch of the imagination. 
 It does. The heated juice *inside the wick* makes the vapor. The coil heats the wick (clapton coils and variations are essentially wrapped in wick), and the juice makes the vapor. It's not hard to understand. With a spaced coil a larger wick area is heated, and more juice vaporized. In essence you're using less wire to cover more area, which makes more vapor and more flavor.  
 Clapton coils are not wrapped in wicks and wicks do not make vapor. You sir, don't understand how this works. The coils vaporize the liquid, the wick just simply delivers the juice to the coil to be vaporized. Heat up some cotton some how and drip liquid on it and then put a new build in something, and before you wick it heat up the coils then drip liquid on the coils. Then come back and tell me what produces the vapor. 
 A clapton wire doesn't absorb juice via capillary action? I think they do, which is the definition of wicking. The wrap also adds mass and functions as a heatsink.  
I suspect saturated cotton heated to 400 degrees would excite liquid enough to aerosolize it. The only method I have to test that theory though is my regulated box, which isn't up to your standards. 
 Yes, capillaries. My mistake, that's not where I thought you were going with that bit. I thought you meant people wrapped cotton around the coils.
Why would a regulated box not work? Go ahead and try to heat cotton to 400 degrees. An easier experiment would try a bare coil, heat it up and drip juice on it. I'll bet money it makes vapor. Because the coil makes the vapor, not the wick. 
 You're really talking about a VERY small change.  Contact coils do not mean that no ejuice is flowing between the actual wraps.  
What you are actually doing by spacing out the wire is using more wire overall, and the amount of surface area that you gain is so small that I would consider it negligible. 
Juice flows FROM the wick to the WIRE where it is vaporized.  The wick is never heated to a temperature that would allow it to vaporize eliquid, otherwise it would burn.
Put the info in here: http://www.steam-engine.org/wirewiz.asp
You'll see the surface area change is very small. 
 And yet the vape difference is not very small? Fire a spaced build. Tell me the entire length doesnt produce vapor. How coil and wick interact makes vapor. Excited juice can be aerosolized regardless of whether is it in the wick core, or contacting the wire. I honestly don't think you, or crowhitler are thinking much about what I'm saying. A vape doing TC set below the burn point of cotton makes vapor, just fact. All vaping is, is exciting and aerosolizing a base. When air flows over the heated wick barrel, the excited juice on it's surface is aerosolized, contact or spaced, that is how a large amount of vapor is made. 
 After doing my first build a month back,i naturally came to the same conclusion. Spaces apart just works so much better. 
 Spacing also saves my wicking, I was doing a lot of spaced coil experiments about six months ago [subtank spaced wicking](https://www.reddit.com/r/electronic_cigarette/comments/4ircw0/kanger_subtanktoptank_rba_wicking_guide/).  The best way I have learned to make great evenly spaced coils is to wrap them as a dual coil and then untwist them so that you have 2 evenly spaced coils. 
 That sounds more difficult than it needs to be.
1.wrap a normal coil
2. Pull the leads apart from each other
3. Push coil together again.
Ta da perfectly spaced coil! 
 Spacing caused spitting on certain juices I tried.
It's both annoying & awesome that rebuildables are infinitely adjustable. 
 I put together my first build yesterday and inadvertently spaced the coils. Is it all downhill from here flavour-wise?!  
 I wouldn't say that. There are many things you can do to alter the flavor more. Different rda/rta, airflow, different type of coil (clapton, twisted, parallel). Also, what good flavor is for OP, is probably different for someone else. 
 Thanks for the tips! I think I'm already over this bottom airflow (tsunami), I can't really minimize the leaks. Can you recommend anything with a bigger deck and airflow that's higher up?  
 I mean flavor-wise, I would give it to my Petri, or Hobo 3.1. Out of the ones I own or have tried those would be my favorite. Not sure how the deck compares to the Tsunami since I have never tried one, but they both have side-airflow.  
 Thanks, I will definitely be looking out for those!  
 Spaced coils are the best! 
 Thanks! 
 I started spacing my coils so that they would fit perfectly on my 30mm RTA... Then I noticed the flavor, and I've never gone back.  Doesn't trash the cotton, and for reference, I only use kanthal, so no TC. Still works wonders. 
 Thanks so much for this post. Couldn't seem to get much flavor out of my serpent, just tried this now and WOW! My new go to coil, easy too. 
 I didn't have any issues on my Mage rocking 7 wraps 24ga Kanthal contact-coils, but I thought meh I have to re-wick it, why not try them spaced coils Reddit's talking about.
And I'm glad I did. Better flavor, better vapor, and a lower resistance that fires at a lower wattage compared to the contact coils. Just dual 5 wraps of the same Kanthal, very easy to do with a coilmaster v3. 
Thank you for the post !  
 How much longer is the ramp up time on spaced? I believe this is the main reason people didn't use spaced. Also, is it true with spaced, you don't have to dry fire? I read a few months ago, dry firing was hazardous. 
 You do have to dry fire to make sure that your coils are heating evenly. It is not dangerous to dry fire kanthal or stainless steel. It is pretty dangerous to fire nickel and titanium 
 Hopefully I saved the link because I have to take a look again, but I'm pretty sure the fact was in general for all metals, or at least not ni and ti. Most however thought the danger was too small.

 New exploit?  How have I not heard about it? 
 Canada's Vape Expo. It was really well advertised up here, probably not so much down south.

 Lucifer is proud.  
 I always set my mods at this. Great flavor. 
 Devilishly good  
 This feels like more of a survey about depression or anxiety than anything. 
Finished it anyway though  
 hey, maybe there's a link 
 The link in the description? I finished the entire thing. It only asked about vaping like twice then got into do you like to look off of high buildings? And do you feel like a failure?. It went from 0 to 100 real quick.  
 I saw three sections.  Are you depressed?  Are you a risk taker?  Do you make significant adjustments to your behaviour to fit into a group?  
I'd wager that the smoker groups are providing a control for the trend/friends vape group to try to identify common traits of non smoker vapers.  Do people who vape for reasons other than not smoking do so because they're depressed?  Are they risk takers?  Do they do it because lots of their friends do it?  We provide a baseline of averages and we can see if non cigarette vapers deviate from our base.   
 As jhkjapan said, I meant a link between vaping and depression/anxiety. Personally I have an anxiety disorder so if that's something OP is looking for he should ask if we're diagnosed with such a disorder in the survey and how vaping has affected it. 
 I believe he meant a link between vaping and anxiety  
 So for Highest Degree you omitted PhD after Masters. I don't know what to choose, so I guess I will just choose Masters... 
 It also doesn't have GED but I make do... ;)

 Its about intent. I intended to be humorous, I'm sorry if I offended you. You intended to be a prick who's butt hurt about not graduating. Its not my fault you have a good enough degree. Lol 
 I literally only said Joke's on you and quoted a link.
Who's butt-hurt...? I'm not even sure why I would be.
Anyway, who cares? 
 This is a retail personality test. Skipped.  
 I stopped when I noticed the survey stopped being about e-cigarette use.  
 Done. Best of luck on your project! 
 Done and done.
Going from the questions, I'm guessing that it has to do with a link between e-cig use and depression and anxiety? 
 Why all the downvotes? 
 You're data will find that I hate myself but have a falsified ego, and that I fucking love vaping.  
 i don't think vapers should trust surveys anymore...
most of them are being used as science(its not)..most of them are biased...most of them are a hidden agenda from university stop smoking programs...pass...hard pass 
 neat. will do this. 
 Did I pass the psychological test? 
 Did it! Do I get a prize now???

 True that :) 
 did it for ya man. felt like that psych test you take when applying for jobs 
 Done, good luck. 
 Done 
 Looks awesome! 
 How much did it cost for all the parts? 
 I had the wood and tools. All the parts cost about $30 not including the rda and batteries.  
 I'm guessing you did the art on the sides as well? I love the style. 
 Yup. I burnt it in with a tool and covered it in polyurethane.  
 That's a work of art. Wonderful job, OP. 
 To be completely honest - and I know I'll probably get downvoted but - I ordered a few BX flavors and I didn't really like them. Maybe it's because I like sweeter flavors, but the ones I ordered didnt have any sweetness to them at all. I ordered like 5 different flavors, and even after letting them steep, they didn't taste good to me. It was disappointing since I'd heard nothing but good things about BX. 
 Hey man it's all just subjective. I generally dislike desert vapes, some people won't touch fruity juices at all. 
 No reason for anyone to downvote you for your personal opinion on our stuff, everyone's taste is different and our lineup isn't for everyone, just like any other juice company. Thanks for sharing, I'm sure I've lost a decent amount of customers due to not adding any sweeteners because a lot of people do like the stuff, it's just not my style though. I think the majority of people prefer them without added sweeteners anyways.  
 Wow. Wasn't expecting a reply from the owner lol. Your stuff is really good still, but like I said I much prefer a sweet taste. I liked the watermelon crack that I ordered quite a bit. Keep up the good work! 
 Absolutely.  If I want sweetened juice I can go buy Cuttwood or whatever the B&M's sell.  I love melonlyptus because it's not a sweet juice.  It's just different from most places.  
 Thanks for the review! It's well written, gives your honest opinion and is pretty short and simple to read, it's how reviews *should* be written. I'm glad you enjoy the majority of them, congrats again on the giveaway and thanks for showing some love ? 
 You should write the descriptions on there web site. Ive read theres and yours makes me want some. 
 I thought melonlyptus tasted like vaping a cough drop. I couldn't stand it although I was quite surprised that it does have a soothing effect on my throat despite being incredibly cold. Hope does it change over time? I'm hoping the mint backs off just a bit and the melon comes out. I couldn't taste even a hint of melon when I tried it  
 I keep a bottle of Melonlyptus around for one reason and one reason only, cold season. 
 I really like mixing melonyptus with honeysuckle my cuke or exotic cactus. It's also super effective straight when you have a cold.  
 Hmmm, I'm gonna have to try mixing melonlyptus and HMC.  I wasn't' a huge fan HMC by itself.   
 I love HMC due to how subtle it is, but sometimes it can almost be bland. Luckily all of the fruit flavors I've tried from b-x blend really well together. For awhile I was rotating melonyptus, HMC, exotic cactus, and watermelon crack all on the same cotton and there were some great combos.  
 The eucalyptus/mint does die down a lot over time, give it 1-2 weeks and it will be a completely different tasting juice. It along with dr in pepper are always made fresh, I would say 30% of people actually enjoy it fresh while the rest love it with a decent bit of steep time. It definitely takes on a much stronger melon taste with time, the eucalyptus is just dominant when it's super fresh  ? 
 Thanks bleux, it's been about 3 weeks now so I'll give it another try soon. I also got horchata-tas and it's delicious. And of course now I want to try honey suckle my cuke and watermelon crack lol. Exotic cactus sounds really interesting too  
 Just make sure to give it a nice shake before using and you should be golden ? 
 Damn, I have somehow avoided bx but your post makes me want to get some of that shit.   
Great quick honest review, this shitpost is to my liking  
 If you like custard get dad's juice and let it steep. You'll find something you like on the line for sure. 
 Melonlyptus dies down after about a week. The menthol fades and the melon comes out. 
 I believe it is memory for customizing your settings for wires (nickel, titanium, SS) in Temperature Control mode.  
 Would you happen to know how? 
 No, sorry. I doubt it works the same on every device. And I'd hate to give you wrong advice. Pretty sure there is a video somewhere on YouTube for it though. There's always a video. 
I'm fairly new to vaping.. Learning as I go. Somebody with better knowledge should be by that could help you, shortly.  
 Thanks for the info. I'll have to look for a video.  
 They allow you to set the temperature coefficients for metals that are not preprogrammed.  It comes with a setting for 316 built in but you could also use 304 or something else by looking up the TCR value and entering it manually.  It probably won't work for Kanthal since I understand the value is less than the 0001 that most mods can go down to.

 That battle deck tho 
 I can all ready taste that flavour 
 If you are using an rda, dry hits are always your own fault. Make sure your cotton is saturated not damp. 
 It is most likely giving you dry hits because of your wicking job. if you have too much cotton is wont soak in very well and cause dry hits, same with to little cotton. Watch some Youtube videos on wicking and try again.  
 Depends on the coils too. Using different metals will provide different results.

:C Damn, I'm just minutes to late.. 
 The folks that decided to buy 2-3 of em might have sped that up.  
 Looks like someone mixed up sale price and discount amount. I'm thinking they meant $13 off their regular price of $51 or something like that. 
 As far as i remember there was the same situation with limitless plus for 8$. But you might be right. 
 they did cancel some of these deals in the past though.
 
 They will most likely email you and the order will be cancelled. With gearbest if it's too good to be true it is indeed not true.  
 Yep that's what exactly happened to me. I just got an email saying there was an error and that I can buy it 49.86$ or some shit and I was like oh well I tried. 
 Gearbest just refunded me through PayPal for this 
 Me too. Oh well, it was worth a shot. 
 They refunded me via Paypal without notice :(. I cannot dispute the order to claim the device. This sucks !
We are regret to inform you that we can not ship your order.Due to our
system update, the coupon code you used on your order is in an error.
This generates a heavy cost to GearBest out of budget.In this case ,we have
to cancel your order.
In order to solve this problems,we can sell this item to at the cost price
($49.24).
You can use the coupon code recoup to get the cost price. 
 Same thing here. If anyone believes PayPal will hold them to the deal, please fill everyone in on how this works. Thank you! 
 For anyone lurking here, heres some basic info you need to know.
1. You have to have an account on gearbest (easy/free)
2. USE PAYPAL. If they try to cancel the orders, paypal will hold them to it.
3. You will NOT be getting these anytime soon. Early January is what I estimate. 
4. The item you are looking for is [THIS](http://www.gearbest.com/mod-kits/pp_513797.html)
5. At shipping options CHOOSE UNREGISTERED AIR WITH THE INSURANCE OPTION CHECKED. 
 How do we go about getting PayPal to hold them to the offer? It seems several people, self included, received emails this am saying they are cancelling our orders. 
 I went to choose registered mail but the only choices were Netherlands and UAE. Figured that ain't right, so I chose the unregistered and insurance for the buck and change. I also used Paypal.  So... your comment has given me hope that it will work out.  
 Can you verify if it's still working? Coupon is giving me an error.

 Sweet. I got the Limitless plus for $8 last time they screwed up, and they actually shipped it. Just picked up a grey one of these for $12.19! Thanks for the tip off! 
 Thanks!   Worth a shot.  Paypal'ed it just to be safe as well.  
 I don't know what I just bought. #blessed 
 Thanks! 
 Thanks for the heads up! Just ordered 
 Absolutely insane for that lol 
edit: Just ordered one. XD 
 Thanks a lot :D ! 
 Thanks! 
 Absolutely Fantastic nearly pulled the trigger on this over a week ago at full price so happy I waited!
Thank You 
 Gf and I just bought each other one for Xmas lol. Might be afterwards until we get it but that's fine. Thanks for the find 
 Wasn't even looking for anything but I'm in for 1 since I spent 3 times as much on a diy order for a handful of flavors. 
 Pulled the trigger as well.  Thanks for the code; hope they honor the deal! 
 In my experience, they will. I got my limitless plus from them for $8 in the same scenario. They turned off the coupon a few hours later and honored everyone who bought one.
I'll probably just sell this thing at a profit, don't really need it, I already use a standalone version of this setup with an alien and limitless plus ... AND I just won a combo rdta from them in a giveaway! 
 Just received the cancellation email so they are not honouring this code. 
 Adding another I got the refund from PayPal. 
Oh well. Time to focus on Black Friday.  
 I just can't bring myself to order anything on presale. It says Dec/12 which can change at any moment plus its around Christmas time which delays orders by weeks from china which means there's a possibility you wont have it till late January. I had this same issue last December when i ordered my RX200 and it didnt arrive for almost 7 weeks. I actually ordered coils from fasttech jan/2 and they came before my rx which i ordered mid December. *EDIT* I know from last year if i want anything from China to order it before Dec/9 for example. 
 And your feeling is correct, gearbest has done this in the past. Get everyone to register an account, cancel the orders as the was a coupon error and then you can't get off their mailing list.  
 Im aware of that but for 13$? Its 50$ worth waiting 
 This is very true, however, I JUST PAID 12.19 FOR AN RDTA BOX, MUAHAHAHAHA! 
*Erm, very well said sir. China is notorious for their multiple week-long holidays. If I wanted it immediately I would have paid full retail.  
 It's back to $60 now. :( 
 Do you have an account for gearbest? It wouldn't show the sale price until I registered and I just ordered a minute ago  
 Thanks! I thought maybe I wasn't doing something right. 
 I registered, but it still says $60.
Edit - Working now, thanks! 
 Same thing happened to me until I confirmed my account in the email 
 I'm seeing this now, This coupon has reached its usage number limit dead? 
 Same here... 
 Would getting the [Mini KP Box 80w Kit] (http://m.gearbest.com/mod-kits/pp_401552.html?wid=21) for $19 make you feel any better?  
 Sadly no :( Was looking for a squonker for a while now... 
 By the way im waiting for that massive 12ml leakage all over the place.. or should we call it liquid flood? I'm wondering about plastic tank absorbing smell of e-liquid, this might be a problem too. 
 Let's call it a Deluge, I wasn't aware of the tank being plastic. That's certainly something I have to remember when using. I can't get over the coolness of this thing. I think if more companies start making this style of mod, it will certainly be the next evolution of squonkers. 
 The plastic tank section is the reason I wouldn't even consider purchasing this. 
 Thanks!  Picked up a yellow one. The chances of it being cancelled are probably pretty good since it's clearly a pricing error, but well worth a shot. Plus, with PayPal, there's recourse if GB decides to just keep my $12 and change and not send anything. 
 Well, I never ordered from gearbest before so I'll go for this at this price.  I'll forget about it and it'll be a nice post xmas gift to myself whenever it arrives! 
 Got my cancellation as well. Not surprised that they cancelled the order, but it would have been nice to get one at that price.  
 UPDATE: got a refund email. Don't think they're happy with us 
 Aaaaand there's my refund email from gearbest and PayPal.  Maybe next time! 
 They cancelled my order this morning and refunded. 
 And just got the message that they are refunding the money and canceling my order fucking pricks 
 Refunded. This thing was ugly anyways, waiting for the smok skyhook. 
 Def wasn't as ugly as you, every time your parents see you they wish they'd of flushed you out of the womb into a garbage can you disgusting bastard 
 Bitchen..... just ordered 2 for $25  Shipping isn't expected till Dec 12th tho.  
 Thats when the presale ends.... that doesn't mean it will ship anytime soon haha 
 Still works. Just ordered 2.  Cannot pass that up for a price like that. Great find! 
 Thanks alot!!! Ordered a yellow one then went back for seconds and picked up a gray. Hope it works out. 
 i ended up buying 3 of these and then was gonna buy like 3 more but the coupon hit it's max limit of usage :(( 
 What part of St. Louis? 
 I'm about to get on 55 south. I'm coming from Ohio  
 I like Mape Vape in maplewood.. Great selection and friendly staff. Downtown has 2 decent ones but I like Speakeasy super classy.. It's St. Louis everything is 15 mins away 
 Red Bird Vape Shop! Tell Adam I said Hi! 
 10/15% off on the 25th, then again 5 or 10% off on the 28th
http://daisychainvaper.com/black-friday-sale-1510-off/
Update: they just announced that the 10/15% off (below and over $100) is valid from 25th to 27th for all categories. 
 Thanks for the heads up!
(By the way, if anyone is wondering..It's 10% off a order of less than $100 or 15% off an order of $100 or more) 
 If I just placed an order is there a way for them to refund the amount back to me? 
 Was your order placed at Fasttech? If so, as long as the order has not shipped, you can cancel the order and get a refund. If you go to your account page and then to the Order details page, you should see an option to cancel your order.
Also the coupon code is not active till the 25th! 
 Thank you <3 
 can I get my cheap Chinese stuff cheaper plz  
 Amen  
 Is there something wrong with that..?
FT holds sales for certain holidays so it's not like it's unexpected. 
 See Black Friday sales thread 
 where might that be? im blind! 
 Hasn't come out yet. But, yes they are having a sale.  
 My suggestion would be the K2 or Top EVOD kit with about an 18mg nicotine level. The AIO and EVOD mega are higher powered devices and may be quite uncomfortable to a beginner. Try either the K2 or Top EVOD first then graduate to the AIO. Your body needs the equivalent amount of nicotine you're in-taking now with which is an 18mg. Using that amount of nicotine in a higher powered device would be too intense. Let your throat and lungs heal first! 
 18mg would be way overkill imo. When I started I got the advice to buy 6mg and 12mg, but to start out as low as possible. If you still feel nicotine craving you can then use the higher nic one. 
 It's a really hard question to answer because everyone is different ? When I started vaping i started with the same mods you have put up but I found that for me they just didn't do it for me so i started buying RDA tanks and a rx200s mod but that's a 150 euro mod and RDA and you have to build the coils so might not suit you.
So out of the ones you mentioned I would recommend the KangerTech my wife had one and it's easy use , charge lasts all day and not expensive ,you should look at the istick as well quite a good mod with a aspire tank .your local vape shop is where I would go they will show you the most popular ones . 
 This https://m.fasttech.com/products/3024/10014058/4024300-authentic-kangertech-topbox-mini-starter-kit worked well for me, comes with a couple different coils and a rebuildable section. All you need is juice and a battery. Plus it's decent enough to run other tanks on if you want to go that route. 
 Subox Mini 
 This is really a subjective and personal area, it's like asking which coffee is better, or which pizza topping  to order. Here's where I might be able to help though... Because I spent three very long and failure filled years finding my sweet spot. 
Something that looks appealing and feels good in the hand and mouth is just as important as its function. I found variable watts and temp control suited me better. Especially the 30 to 40 watt range. Not too hot, not too cool, perfect cloud, satisfying inhale. I like a heavier mod, something I can wrap my hands around and really grip. I like matching colors. Lol. 
I did not like the higher nic levels, I find I'm perfectly content with the 3 to 6 mg range with max vg, it burns less, it hurts less, the flavors are cleaner, and I'm not dealing with the shakes. 
I also dont like stainless steel drip tips. They give me chapped, raw lips. I like variable air flow. Sometimes I want rich deep flavor and big clouds, sometimes I want to chain vape and not fog up whatever room I'm in. 
I like Dual battery setups versus on 18650. I have to charge less often. I also like bigger tanks and rdas. I have to juice up less often. 
I like Subohm. It's more satisfying and less lung work. 
This k of what you're looking to get out of the experience and explain those concerns to your local shop owner. More likely than not, they'll know what you need and will save you a ton of wasted time, money, and effort. Good luck! Half the fun is shopping and finding items that suit you.  
 Thanks everyone for your suggestions. I will definitely go to  my local vape shop and ask for recommendations. 
 Every one of those companies should be slapped up the side of the head with a brick for even offering non-adjustable batteries in 2016.  All of those little turds you listed were obsolete five years ago.  An eGo type battery is fine but get one with a voltage adjustment ring on the bottom.  
The Aspire tanks are great and they have several models that take the small BVC atomizer.  
If you buy a unit with adjustable output you will not be looking for something better in two weeks time. 
 My car can go 160 mph.  It doesn't mean I need to drive 160 mph in order to use it to it's full potential.  The handling, comfort, and pickup are the reason I love my car.
Likewise, just because your mod goes to 220 doesn't mean you're being limited using it at lower wattages.  Having 220 watts available means you can, if you choose, run incredibly low resistance builds at very high wattages without your device limiting you.  But if you're using a coil head that is rated at 40-60 watts,  you'll be getting an ideal experience vaping in that range.  If you kick it up too high, you'll get burnt hits, or worse melt that coil right off.  That's not using the devices potential,  it's just misusing the device. 
 I wish I could up vote this more than once. Very well said for someone that gets excited about going up to higher wattage mods.  
 I can totally see where you are coming from and thanks for that on the coils. But what i meant was, in a better way of saying it, I leaned more towards the alien because i liked the idea of a higher wattage to play around with. But thank you :) 
 Then get a rebuildable. that will allow you to use higher wattages. 
 i have a few rda's. i was just wondering about the tfv8 baby 
 If you go over the rate that your coils can handle you will ruin your coil. Going up to 220W isn't even really a feature now a days, because unless you're building your own coils you're never going to vape that hot - and a hot vape isn't enjoyable to everyone.  
 I'm vaping the cloud beast at 210 watts right now. Prebuilt sextuple heads haha 
 Shh.. if someone has to ask what they can actually vape, then they shouldn't be going past 100w.  
 okay thanks. 
 Bro just find a wattage you feel comfortable with. Seriously, the higher wattages are for huge builds that need lots of heat to avoid ramp up. Don't just try and vape all high wattage all the time, you'll go through batteries, juice, and coils like crazy. your shit might get hot. Find a wattage that gives you the vape you like. I have the rx200 and rarely vape past 110. My all day vape range is 70-95. Just cause my mod does 250 doesn't mean i need to use that. Don't get stuck in my mod goes up to 200 so i'm gonna vape at 180 all day lol it's a waste man. It has it's uses, but doing so on prebuilt coil heads is likely a waste. Find a vape you like, don't worry about the waste it seems for not using it at crazy cloudsbroclouds rates. 
 That is a good way of thinking about it, thanks for opening my eyes! 
 Get out there and find that sweet spot bro. If you ever get into the rebuilding game you may learn to appreciate those higher wattages a bit, but don't go crazy now. Also if you do go high wattage, make sure you have some great batteries to handle the amperage. Even with a regulated box mod, be safe out there brotha! 
 ive already rebuilt a little. i was just wondering about the tfv8 baby, but thanks :) 
 But THESE go to 11! 
 Roommate grabbed the alien220 combo with the baby beast to start with. 
He sets it around 50-65 watts and it isn't overpowerful to him, so if that's a worry of yours, you're good.
I like the way the alien feels in hand. No looking for the fire button, just squeeze and you're good to go. 
With that baby beast tfv8 on it, the flavor is great and the vapor is smooth and plentiful, I recommend it.
If you get bored of the baby after a while, grab the cloud beast tfv8. Holy clouds and flavor Batman.
Be forewarned though, that upgrade will cost you most in juice! You'll run though a 30ml bottle in a day and even  3mg nicotine will get you to much of head rush to vape a lot. Also it's not a chain vape at higher watts, gets really hot.
This is probably more than what you were asking, but I ramble. 
 More info is always better than not enough!
I'm down to 12mg now from 18mg and am only going through about 2-3ml a day with the Plato. I use my Plato at home and in my car. At work I use just a cheapy V2 filled with Black Note's Legato. 
I guess my question is basically should I stick with the Plato for a while instead of dropping ~$100 on a new mod, tank and batteries. My Plato is doing its job just fine and I have no real reason to upgrade other than looking at the long term picture and wanting something better. Would I really notice that much of a difference between the Plato and the Alien to justify the upgrade? 
 And yes, you will definitely notice a difference! 
 What differences should I expect?
Thank you again for all of the support! I really appreciate it.  
 Actually you can grab the setup for 59.99 from vapordna (not including batteries of course).
If you're already content on current setup, I would say to stay there. 
If you're wanting to move up to the bigger mods, you really need to go down on the nicotine. 12mg is going to wear higher wattage coils and builds down very quickly and will make you feel sick. 
Thinking long term is also dependent on what you're trying to do. Replace nicotine source or quit it all together. 
When I tried to quit before I just used a basic all in one, such as the plato, and slowly decreased nicotine until I got to zero, then gave away the build and was good to go. I started smoking again, being around old friends in the South that all smoke.
Now I've just replaced it, and also got trigger happy on the clouds and such from the bigger mods. Went from the original Kbox 30w and kfun (pos as far as I'm concerned) to the Kbox 200w  and a uwell crown v1. Used that build happily for a year. Now that I've moved again, no shops around here carry the coils anymore, due to the v2 crown, so I moved on to another build. Finally got me to the alien220 and tfv8 baby beast.
Now I'm happily vaping at 60w at 3mg and haven't touched a cig, besides when drunk, for over a month.
It's really a judgement call on what you feel is best, keep on and wither down or upgrade and replace. 
 
 Could you post a pic of the problem? 
 http://m.imgur.com/gallery/PJKaX 
 you can use a drill bit and unscrew them (obviously one that's small enough to fit tightly into the heads). 
Don't let the drill bit touch the posts as it will create burrs when unscrewing. 
 There is not much of texture for the drill bit to grab on to. I have no problem with the screws that are on the positive posts bcs they have not been rounded out as badly (i can get them off with a allen key which was included) but not the screws on the negatives.
Or do i just use a really small drill bit and apply pressure so there is some friction so i can unscrew them? 
 Get an Allen key drill bit or a screwdriver and stretch out a rubber band on the worn out head. 
 Also, https://youtu.be/SEZyUzt8xys might help. 
 Could not get the screws out with the tips in that video. Luckily i have a new RDA coming in the mail. Now i know do not boil the screws on wotofo products when you are getting rid of machine oil 
 I like that car 
 Well thank you. It was my achievable dream car.

 Mod: wismec reuleaux rx2/3
Tank: cleito 120
Juice: drip line- bass nectar freeze  3mg 
 How's that 120? I have the original and I gotta say the tip gets way to hot at just 70 watts, while my smok baby beast can do 80 and not get anywhere near as hot 
 Love it. I had the original and this is fantastic. Very smooth and easy to hit. 
 Is this an STI?  I miss my 07 SWP STI :( 
 2007 (: 
 There are plenty of non-nicotine liquids out there, since making liquid is an additive process (vs. making decaf coffee, which is a subtractive process) most makers will also make 0mg versions. Many people who are quitting smoking will get down to 0mg and keep vaping for the habit of it.
This is not to say that I recommend vaping if you don't smoke, the jury's still out on whether it's *safe* (though it's definitely saf*er* than smoking, just not ruled as completely harm free yet). 
 I vape and have never smoked a cigarette before, I use nicotine free liquid so no never have had a strong urge or any addiction. Once in a while I'll feel like it, I mainly started because the flavors taste good and I like blowing smoke rings  
 life long nonsmoker aside from a cigar or pipe now and then, i vape almost everyday, 0-3mg. i can and do go days without it however and dont really think about it. Its just fun to do. 
 Almost all vape juice (as i have seen) is availble in zero and other quantities of nicotine. I used to smoke. I been on vape for 3 years.  
 I never smoked cigs but I picked up vaping and I vape a ton of 3mg. I am pretty addicted to it but only like how you can get addicted to coffee. If I want to take a break, it sucks for the first day or so and after that it's not bad. I've been vaping for over 2 years.  
 Yes you get addicted and yes, absolutely any juice you find will have a nicotine free option. 
 Are you saying you'll get addicted from nicotine free options?
 
 No you will not! Sorry, I can see how that could be misleading 
 20 year smoker here. Quit smoking 5 or 6 years ago. Now vape 0 nic and have for about a year, however I can have a friends vape with high nicotine and it doesn't make me want to have nicotine at all, even if I've been vaping it all week. Nic vaped is vastly different than smoking it. 
0 nic is awesome though. I just like doing it still so that's why I haven't stopped and only would if I ever stopped liking it.  
 OP, you're pulling more than 27amps from one battery with that setup, what battery are you using? 
 Op is dead, expect no answer  
 Rip 
 No offence but that does not look like a good / wise / safe setup  
 BE CAREFUL mech mods are dangerous and the tfv8 IS NOT MEANT TO BE RUN ON A MECH. 
You are pulling more power than the battery can safely provide. This is the kind of thing that you see in before I blew a hole in my leg videos 
 Get you a regulated box for that tank dude. 
 is that a 0.15 ohm coil ? 
 The ramp up time would make it not worth it.
Just get a single coil setup on an rta.  
 Due to a lot of comments I've been getting, I'd like to let everyone know that I am aware that this setup isn't the best idea. I was previously using this tank on my Eleaf but it fell out of my backpack and broke, so now I'm left with the Magneto. I do have a Mason rda that I'm going to put on instead of the tank. I've only had the tank on for a while, but as a lot of you have said, it's not a very good idea. Thanks for looking out for me and letting me know that my decision wasn't wise! It's good to see that this community looks out for its members and offers advice! 
 Good on you for actually taking the criticism lol. I finally made myself recycle old batteries from this community and I don't regret it at all  
 I started vaping a few months ago so I'm still learning and getting a feel for stuff. I'll take any criticism and advice I can get! Nobody is an expert from the start and we've all made mistakes. 
 Looks so interesting lol. Welcome! 
 Yeah the tank is pretty damn big compared to the mod! But hey, it works! 
 It works until it blows up in your mouth.  
 /u/ChristianComa
You will be in a coma if you keep running that setup.  
 Looking good. You know the saying. If it's not broke than don't fix it. I've got a few oldies that are still kicking it strong.  
 Hell I've still got my first setup a nautilus mini on an Eleaf 20 watt  
 That was my first setup as well, and it still kicks when I feel like firing it up.  
 Heck yeah. I've still got mine. Always a favorite I go back to again and again.  
 It's probably the most reliable stealthy style mod I have. Everything else is kinda bulky or not easily pocketable.  
 Ipv5 is retro~!? I use mines as my daily lol.love it. 
 That is not an ipv 5. I believe it is an ipv d3, and I actually just busted mine out the other day for the first time in a long while. Great little stealthy mod! 
 It's even older than that. It's a D2. 
 Tsunami are still great! 
 Jeez it's not even thanksgiving yet!?! 
 Lulz in november 
 Take pumpkin out ,check. Put up Christmas  tree ,check.Go buy turkey for thanksgiving , ok

 Vaporesso Tarot 200w with a velocity RDA. Swagg Sauce Maui Waui Milk! 
 Everytime I see this I think Terrance & Phillip.  Might get one just because. 
 Lmfao.. good idea but I usually try to avoid having take my vape In the bathroom, to me that's like eating in a bathroom. 
 Well at least I wait til I wash my hands... Unlike voopers.  
 Lol 
 You only wish you were one of us. I might as well be shitting blueberry Yoghurt and pissing strawberry milk.  
 So is that what's actually inside froyo machines? Just some guy  just soft-serve vooping into your cup as you pull the lever? Actually makes a LOT of sense..  
 https://youtu.be/YbYWhdLO43Q
This isn't even my final form.  
 If you don't repost this link with the title how it feels to voop. You're all missing out I'll do it for you. You have 2 hours.  
 Accepted.  
 Vooplyfe 
 I don't but I'm gonna start doing that 
 Yeah I just get a VERY minor hotbox and then let the fan clear it out. People go in after and say it smells super good lol. I almost feel like the odor particles get trapped better in the vapor? Idk but it works really well for me 
 Propylene glycol is used in air fresheners for just that reason. It is very good at trapping small particles.  
 Aha! I'm brilliant 
 Why have I never thought of this... 
  I try this at my girlfriends house. She says it smells like shitty [insert whatever flavor I'm vaping] 
 this the only way I can use the porta johns on the job site I'm at. except I'm not very discreet fill it with clouds and enjoy my time in there  
 It's the TURDIS! ?  
 I would recommend the Smok Alien out of those two. It is a device which provide you with more options in future, 220w, replaceable batteries etc. The baby beast also has a separate RBA base so you do not need to just buy coils.
Though with the baby beast your juice usage may increase. 
 Baby beast is fine for flavor. It's the only tank with pre-built coils that I keep around for when I can't use a rebuildable.
The smok alien is one of the best mid-prices mods out at the moment. 
 Do you want a tank with pre-built coils? 
 Yes I like prebuilt I don't really have any interest in rebuildables 
 The baby beast is probably your best bet then 
 Who are you asking? 
 OP if he doesn't mind rebuilding I'd recommend the Avocado. Best tank I've ever used. But it is solely rebuildable.  
 The Coolfire mod is perfect and I guess you wan something with internal batteries like you have now so you dont have to worry about charging all the batteries right. Just plug in and then its charged.
The tank is decent (still better than the one you have now i guess) but the Aspire Cleito is my go to tank. Never leaking and perfect flavor without it drinking to much juice. 
 Ooooh. That tank sounds really nice. My local shop has the coolfire and if they have that tank I'll probably go with that! Thanks  
 Im not sure but I think you can't buy the Coolfire without the tank (the tank is included) so try that first and see if you like it. If not try the Aspire Cleito with the .4 coils 
 How you liking the alien?
Edit: just realized the uniform. Thank you for your service! 
 I love it. Great battery life so far and solid for the price point. Thank you for the appreciation. 
 Smok alien & my old baby beast. 
Headed to the field this weekend and had to bring something. Never had to touch my spare set of batteries. I did vape in moderation tbh (10 puffs here and there @60watts on the T8 coil.) 
 First off thank you for your service. Nice setup. I did run the same, but I just switched to the cloud beast which is a battery killer. 
 I use everything I own on it. Mainly a griffin 25p/obs engine/ijoy combo or one of my rda's.  
 Smok alien. 
 May I ask why? is it a better mod then my fuchai 213? I'm not really educated of these things.  
 I've been seeing a lot of alien mods lately, I like them as well. I have an Rx 2/3 myself 
 Slightly smaller.
 Accurate TC. 
Capable of doing the advertised 220w (although I never vape over 100). 
Reads resistance accurately. 
The battery life I've gotten from it rivals my Rx in 3 battery config and is better than other dual battery mods (takes battery down to 3.2v instead of 3.6). Was actually able to get three days of vaping (moderately) this weekend with it at 50-65w. That was with 2 Samsung 25rs... Didn't even use my new Samsung 30Q's.
Thoroughly enjoying my alien. 
 how does it feel in your hand? it looks clunky. I usual vape between 70-80. Will I get bigger cloud or more flavor or is that all on the clieto?  
 Clouds and flavor depends on the atomizers.
It isn't clunky. It's very convenient and fits nicely in the hand. I had it in my pants (ankle pocket of my uniform) and pulled it out to vape on throughout the day. 
 My best experiences have been with Sigieli and Wismec. 
All my experiences with SMOK have been downright TERRIBLE. (TFV4,  tfv8, and multiple mods). As soon as I get coils for my Clieto 120, I'm swearing them off completely (tfv8 is my main tank right now). 
IPV is nice,  but they're a little... Odd.  My 3 and 4 are great.  They're my backups.  My 5 and 6 are really janky.  Especially the 6. Only still running the 6 because my gf thinks matching setups are cute.  
Wismec is fantastic.  Their mods,  tanks,  RTAs and RDAs are phenomenal and worth every penny you pay for them. Except for the Theorem RTA. Fuck that little POS.
Sig makes my absolute favorite mods.  I've got a OG Sig 150 and the Fuchai 200w. Freaking tanks. Beat em,  throw em, use and abuse them.  They'll stick with you through anything and everything. 
Out of everything on the market right now,  imho,  your best bet,  aside from /u/amdcursed's mods (check him out,  btw.  Great dude,  I have one of his unregulated mods,  fantastic little piece) is Wismec and Sig.  
 the RX2/3 is what my friends have I was considering that. So do you think I should buy another fuchai or go with the RX 2/3?
Also I'm not familiar around these parts /u/amdcursed makes mods and sells them around here? are they better then the ones I listed above? Sorry if thats insulting I'm just not very knowledgeable about vaping yet I'm just a baby.
But I'm a do it once and do it right kinda guy so I like to buy top quality items rather then cheap out  
 2/3s is a great little mod. I also love the 200s, but the 2/3s is the winner here because of the 2 or 3 battery capability. I'd either do that or give Sig another shot. I cant believe you dropped yours and it broke. 
Yeah.  He makes both unregulated and regulated boxes in both 18650 and 22650. I've got his dual unregulated parallel box. Extremely high quality work, and super cheap for what you get too.  I have yet to find another unregulated box that hits like mine does. I paid $120 for mine,  it would have been 100, but I splurged on a CNC box. I know prices have gone down since then.  Head over to /r/cursedmods and check him out. 
 > He makes both unregulated and regulated boxes in both 18650 and 22650
Can you explain what this means so i can be more educated before I make a purchase? I want to make sure I'm buying the right mod for me 
 Sure. To put it simply, a regulated box is like your 213. On/off button,  display screen,  adjustable wattage. 
An unregulated box is essentially a mechanical mod. That you can put tanks on. No adjustable wattage,  fires at a set amperage,  no on/off switch,  etc.  And if it's parallel, you HAVE to make sure the batteries are in right.  Otherwise you run the risk of screwing your mod up,  because of it's direct connection  
 Okay so for someone like me who isn't planning on dripping anytime soon and is sticking with the cleito, who usually vapes at 70-80, what would you reccomend I go for if i wanna buy one from /u/amdcursed? 
 Sorry mate, fell asleep. 
I believe he has a 60w regulated mod that would suit you perfectly. 
I'm not a representative, I don't know exactly what all he builds, but it's all over on /r/cursedmods, and you can shoot him a PM. He's a really nice dude and will work with you to get you exactly what you want. 
For you, I think I'd run with either the Truck 120, Truck PWM, or Truck Mini (120w or 60w versions)
https://www.reddit.com/r/cursedmods/comments/3o61qk/how_to_order_your_truck_box_mod/
Really, you could roll with any but the last 3.  
 okay thank you for everything. lat question do the 120w only vape at 120 or can I adjust it up to 120? 
 Yeah,  it's adjustable. 
If you don't mind my asking,  what Clieto do you have?  
 clieto 120. I've heard people say it's the best tank out there for beginners who don't make there own coils since you can buy the replacements pretty cheap. I was looking into buying pre built coils online if I wanted to upgrade but I was told it is not worth it. 
I was told [these on etsy](https://www.etsy.com/search?q=coil%20clapton%20) and ones on ebay are overpriced and not that good 
What do you think of the clieto 120? should I be looking to upgrade,especially if I get a truck box? how are those pre made coils? Sorry I'm throwing all these questions at you, but I appreciate all the help. 
 Sigelei j150 because fuck taking batteries out to charge them 
 I'd go with an RX2/3. It goes up to 200w in dual 18650 mode and 250 in triple 18650 configuration. Awesome design. Accurate tc and time tested.  
 Icare is definitely a good product. I actually bought one for my grandma to get off the smokes. But in terms of flavour and cloud production it is lacking significantly. You have to pretty much get a 50/50 juice for it to work adequately. 
 Ah how does she like it? I mix so getting some 50/50
Wouldn't be too much of a problem, guessing I'd have to up the nicotine aswell as I'm on 3mg ATM? I'll only really use it as an out and about  
 She personally likes it alot. However it's not something I enjoyed, vaping on such a low ohms and high power has really made the icare obsolete, it feels like nothing in comparison. The coils are not sub ohm so the nicotine dilevery is less so you might wanna go up some to feel it.  
 Thanks man:) 
 I just got one for work and I really like it. At home I vape a TFV8 on an RX200 with 6mg nic but with the icare I bumped it up to 12. IMO it works best with 60/40 vg/pg. Doesn't necessarily pack a punch but you will consume less juice and be able to vape in stealth much easier.  
 Thanks :) think I'll get one for out n about  
 I just picked one up last week for the same reasons. At home I normally drip 3mg but use 12mg for my iCare. It's definitely a mouth to lung device. The battery last really well, especially if it's not your primary vape. 
 Ah nice, so I'll probably go and get some 12mg, is that about right for you? Also did you get the mini or the normal one? 
 If you're on 3mg now, 12mg on the iCare should be good. I haven't tried any high VG juice in it. 50/50 mix seems to be working well. 
 Alright thanks for the info :) I'll get some 50/50 
 What app is that? 
 Vape. It's in the Android market, not sure if it's available for iPhone. It's not really a good motivator, per se, but it is nice to track progress and savings.  
 Congrats! 
 How olds ya coil 
 Almost 2 weeks. But still pretty white 
 May be the end of your coils lifespan. It may also be gunked up due to the sweeteners in the juice. 
 Did you prime the coil well and start low in wattage then work your way up? 
 I start at about 40 watts 
 Just replace the coil. � 
 My advice is to clean your contacts and get a Tsunami RDA or a Herakles RTA, my other advice: sound a little bit more professional. 
 Omfg buddy it's vaping chill tf out why you so passionate about vaping lmfao sound more professional get a life buddy ahahahaha. But thanks for the other advice don't know wtf a contacts is but thanks 
 Also add me, I'm a Yasuo main that would appreciate a good Lee, February Skies.
 
 Contacts referring to the 510 pin at both the bottom of your RDA and mod. They should both be either gold or copper in color. Just wipe that shit with some rubbing alcohol, you should be good. 
 Clean your 510 connection, Cuboid has a weird square pin for some reason. I had one of them, and ended up giving it away because it annoys the fuck out of me.
As the person above/below me mentioned, get a Tsunami RDA. If you want RTA, I personally liked the Griffin. Or, you could spend a bit extra and get a Dotmod RDA, because they're just the best (imo) 
 Thanks  
 Just got a Tsunami 24 myself and I'm loving it. 
 Thanks 
 +1 for the Tsumani 24. Had mine a week and i think its great. Nice sized build deck and get some great flavour.
Also im a real big fan of the Limitless RDTA - very close to RDA flavour with a nice big tank. Wick it right and it doesnt leak. 
 If you're having leaking issues. And you don't like it. Fucks sakes do not get an rda. The Griffin 25 mini works well on the cuboid, wotofo serpent mini, coil art mage. Low wattage tanks work well on the cuboid due to the amp limit set up on it. 
 Okay lit thanks so
Basically get a griffin 25 mini?  
 It's a great choice. What kind of vape do you like? Really airy? Or warm and dense? 
 I like lots of vape and flavour  
 Avocado 24 
 Tsunami 24 or troll v2 are really easy to build on and really nice! 
 Agreed, the Tsunami 22 is a piece of cake too. Just got one, and I'm in love. It's so much easier to line up coils with airflow holes than on three post RDAs 
 I agree with the Tsunami. The deck is very easy to use and quite roomy.  
 I love the doge v3! The deck is easy to build on and perfect for a new RDA user. An even easier and cheaper RDA would be the tobecco Velocity clone. It is not an authentic RDA but imo it hits almost the same as the real deal.  
 I'd say either the Sapor or Lush by Wotofo! Tsunami is pretty straight forward too.  
 Royal Hunter,  Sapor, plume veil.  
 First RDA i got was 9 hells 13 heavens took me 20 mins to get it going after installing pre built coils and wicking them 
 I don't know if any of the RDAs come with pre built coils, but I know you can order them online already wrapped. Just have to put them in the RDA and wick them. 
As for a nice RDA, I have a tsunami 24 and love the build deck and bottom airflow on it. Coils come out perfect almost every time. Cheap price too.  
 I learned on my Tsunami, very easy to build on/install prebuilt coils, jus upgraded to a Limitless RDA  
 What's your budget? Very few authentic atomizers come with prebuilt coils honestly. 
With that said, if you want good flavor, I'm a fan of the petri, and the hadaley is touted as having good flavor.  
 I meant the pre rolled wicks I guess haha 
 You mean like prerolled stainless steel mesh? I've never seen any RDA come with mesh. Even Genesis style attys don't come with prerolled mesh. 
Or do you mean like...cotton that is rolled and ready to be wicked? I've never seen an RDA come with that either.  
 I mean pre rolled coils for the rda. I'm a total beginner. Been thinking of getting doge 3 ... what pre rolled coils and cotton should I use? 
 Eleaf icare 
 This is cheap and a nice discreet size. I will definitely search some reviews, thanks for the advice 
 I've tried using a couple of my devices on my mom, didn't work. I tried the elegant looking Joyetech eCab, she liked it but couldn't get used to it and complained about it leaking. Next, I tried giving her an AIO Box but she said it was too strong for her (I used a 6mg liquid) and wasn't even close to a cigarette. Though I guess this is because she doesn't want to quit. Electronic cigarettes aren't magic sticks that will immediately get you off of smoking, so your mother needs to have the will to quit. 
Otherwise, you can't really go wrong with the economic Joyetech devices.  
 Thanks, I'll look into those. The joyetech ego model is very cheap too, and has bigger battery than the eleaf icare. It looks better for my untrained eye
I just want to give her the option. I think it is a good method of dosing down nicotine dependency at least. It would also help with cough 
 Oh yeah, definitely go for it. If she likes it, she will most definitely reduce her cigarette consumption, if not quit them all together. It will also be great to give her a quick rundown of all the ins and outs since due to improper use, you can experience leakage, dry burns, low vapor and bad taste. At least I did in the beginning. All in all, it's a great investment and you will most definitely provide your mother with an amazing gift.  
 The joyetech AIO is a great starter kit. However, if it is meant for a medium to heavy smoker as a transition device, I would recommend a 1.5 ohm coil (heating element) for a beginner. That way the correct nicotine can be given with a decent amount of vapor. It will be an easier transition. On a side note, make sure you know how many cigarettes are being smoked to give her the correct nicotine that she needs. 
 It depend on how old your mother is.  Some tanks are hard for older people to use.  There are some easy to use top fill tanks but most of them are too large to fit on a pen sized power pack.  If filling is not a problem I have a Vision Spinner powering an Aspire K-1 tank and it works very well.  Whatever you buy try to get something that has adjustable output so the power can be adjusted.  
A good type of fluid to start with is cigarette flavoured in 12 mg/ml strength.  There is also menthol flavoured juice for those that like menthol.  Good luck. 
 She's able but not willing. She will complain anyway
I would like her to at least try. I've got no idea what to look for. The suggested eleaf icare reviews are good, they say it's simple too 
 Yeah, they are really pushing these new unregulated mods.  Every company that makes such a thing in 2016 needs a good hard slap.  Unregulated devices are great for people that want to say they tried vaping before going back to smoking.  In my experience temperature control is better than variable wattage which is better than variable voltage which is better than unregulated.  Each one is slightly better than what went before but TC is a big improvment over unregulated.  I did own an unregulated device once but I would never buy one again.  A common variable wattage setup that worked for a vast multitude of smokers was the iStick 30 and Aspire Nautilus or Nautilus mini tank. There is no way that any unregulated mod can compare to that. 
 So I assume the temperature control ones are usually very expensive.
The istick 30 costs $30, I assume that one is wattage control. It may be a bit complicated to use but looks like a good option. I agree I shouldn't buy the crappiest and to scare her forever. This is however the max price I think I would pay to try them. May I ask how does it affect the wattage control to smoking? What is it for? Pushing buttons and regulating seems complicated. I going to search some videos, so far this may be the best option
The nautilus ones I don't understand what I see, it seems they mostly sell parts for it on aliexpress, and the whole kit is around $50? 
 When temperature control came out the mods cost hundreds of dollars.  Then Joyetech brought out the Evic VTC kit with Cubis tank for around $100 including the lithium cell.  I have the Cubis tank but not the Evic and the tank works well.  Last August I bought the Vaporesso Target mini kit with Guardian tank for less than what I paid for my VW iStick 30 and Nautilus mini tank together.  
The Target mini is a great mod but it uses ceramic coils and there is currently a scare going around about those.  The panic is about the same as the dioxin, Y2K, and ozone layer panics of a few years ago.  Same kind of crap, different year.  The styling of the Target mini looks manly to me and there may be some choices that have more aesthetic appeal for the ladies.  
Vaping Heathen gives a good review of some of the lower cost TC devices at https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRm7KKoyTv8 
The Mini Q by Daonetech looks really nice and uses the Cubis coils which are readily available but I have not seen that kit for sale anywhere.   Some gear is vaporware that never becomes available before it gets cancelled.  That would be sad for such a nice little mod as that one appears to be.
TC is nice and VW is almost as good but i also like my emergency back up unit which is a variable voltage Vision Spinner 400 and Aspire K-1 tank.  When taken apart it fits just right inside my old cigarette case but the little guy can still deliver satisfying puffs of nicotine.  Anyway, good luck with your shopping.
 According to [this](http://forums.aspirecig.com/discussion/28853/tc-coils-for-nautilus-x-and-atlantis-evo) discussion on the aspire forums, yes you can. However you can't use the nautilus x coils in the pockex. 
 thanks for the help 
 I bought the Joyetech AIO 2 days ago as my first vape and I've been loving it so far. The kit comes with a second coil for replacement FYI.  
 In my experience TC is better than VW which is better than VV which is better than unregulated.  TC mods and unregulated mods require the least amount of fiddling.  VW is not too bad but with VV you should check coil resistance every few days.  TC with stainless steel coils works very well but the gear is not the cheapest.  The cheapest TC setup I have seen is the Vaporesso Target mini kit with Guardian tank.  The coils cost more than average but seem to last longer.  If you don't want ceramic coils (they are actually atomizers) then one of the Joyetech Cubis series tanks looks good and works fine on the Vaporesso mod.  An Evic VTC would be good too but a complete setup will cost more than $60.  Good luck. 
 Menthol will be tough to shift from a pre built coil that's for sure, although a lot of people do enjoy it as part of their fruit flavour so maybe give it a try first?
Like the other poster said we need a bit more information about your setup however in general:
A hot wash of the tank and mouthpiece along with a new coil should work, if not then soak the tank in alcohol (vodka will do fine). 
 Menthol will stick. Need a little more info on your setup. Is it a rebuildable tank or what? If you have any more new coils laying around, you're going to need to use them. I like to use 1 coil per flavor category
 New coil. Keep the old one for use again with another menthol liquid.  
 It's a Coolfire IV with a I Sub G tank 0.5ohm coil 
 Menthol is forever. You're going to need a new coil.  
 If its prebuilt coils then just clean your tank thoroughly and then put a new coil in. Should get rid of it completely. Just make sure you saturate your new coil before using it that way you dont burn it. 
 You'd be surprised. I loved menthol with watermelon. A little dab will do it.  
 Anything minty or menthol truly sticks to a coil. Very hard to get out. You are able to run your coil under water to help extract that flavor. You will have to let it completely dry out before using it again since it won't work properly if you do. When all else fails, change your coil. 
 Ended up vaping it with some Heisenberg which already has menthol in it..ended up deciding to just to use that coil with menthol as you were all right saying I couldnt get the flavour out. 
 I got the coffee at Jewel Osco and I ordered the Cuttwood from www.eliquid.com
 Love coffee flavors. Where'd you get them?  
 I think OP is talking about actually brewing and drinking a cup of coffee along side vaping their cutwood juices. I could be wrong though.
I've enjoyed pairing a cherry clove flavor up with a nice fireside vanilla spice, or chai tea (again, the vape flavor mentioned first, the beverage mentioned second.) It's fun figuring out what pairs well with what. 
 I go to [ECBlend](http://www.ecblendflavors.com/red-energy-eliquid-flavor/) first and you can read the reviews (they leave the bad ones up) but they are in the US and I get the idea you are not. 
 nah im not but id be happy to order if they ship to UK, I don't mind paying shipping. 
 Demon Energy (available from Mt Baker Vapor) I don't think this is their own house juice iirc
Tastes like monster energy drink 
Raging Bull (Mt Baker Vapor) this is a house juice I believe 
Tastes like red bull 
 Awesome! A monster energy flavour. I'll try this for sure thanks! 
 Not sure there is one in that form factor 
 I would check out the Joytech AIO. It has an internal tank and uses ss 316 coils. They make 1.2 ohm and my favorite 0.6 ohm coils. Holds 2ml of juice. Slightly adjustable airflow. And comes with two tips. One for mouth to lung and one for direct. I used one for 4-5 months before I got my first RDA and I loved that little fella.
http://www.joyetech.com/product/ego-aio/?age-verified=720816330a 
 Could you tell me which one is mtl and which one direct? I'm currently using the black one, the kit also came with a transparent one.  
 Guy at the shop said the the clear one is for direct as it is more open and allows you to draw in easier. And the plastic one slows the vapor and swirls it to cool it a bit, making it easier to pull on it like a cigarette. Sounds a bit like bs but a do notice the plastic mouthpiece is more restrictive. 
 Hmm, I'll try it later and report back but that makes sense. Thanks a lot!  
 I feel so ripped off. I bought this last week at a vape shop for $50 and they're selling it online for $21.  I love it though.  
 Damn. I feel the same way shopping in vape shops for hardware. I just bought a 75w pico and a battery for $60 the other day and then went online like wtf. But I live in pa so I understand we have a 40? tax. I got my Aio in Philly for $23 before the tax hike. 
 Eleaf iCare $20. The Mini with the PCC (charging case) is $35, slimmer than the regular icare but both use the same coil (1.1ohm), and fire fully charged at 15w. Not a cig style (auto draw though) but small enough to pocket/palm; i haven't used a vuse but battery life will be better and you can use your own juice and recharge via micro usb and will compliment any traditional setup in ease of use. Usually i use 3mg, in the icare i use 6mg to avoid chain vaping.
 I suppose the Eleaf icare is good as someone has already suggested, or you could try something of the ego style like the JACVapour E-Series. I did some looking around and can't find anything as small as a Vuse but Ego's are probably the closest, most of them tend to be quite small. If you want something TINY you could have a look at the Joyetech eGo ONE Mini. http://www.joyetech.com/product/ego-one-mini 
 Von erl or juul 
 Rewrap it. It's easy to do and the wraps will only run you a couple of cents 
 So shouldn't I use it before rewraping?
I will check how to rewrap it. Thanks :-)  
 Electrical (black) tape can help patch while you wait for your wrap. If you're using a mechanical mod, it may make it too tight for insertion/removal or peel off though. 
 You shouldn't, no. It's better to be safe than sorry 
 Some vape shops offer rewrapping. It's inexpensive to get it done! 
 At mine it's $0.25 wraps and they do it free. 
 There is a golden rule that states if you have to ask its time to rewrap. 
 every time i see one of these posts...   
all i can think to my self is...   
if you have to ask...the answer is gonna be no.  :) 
 Make battery's save again!
Sorry.. couldn't not do it. 
 Need to prime the coil, or let it sit a little longer. If it still tastes burnt try and turn your voltage or wattage down and keep going down in small increments until you find it tastes how you want it to. 
 Thanks, this makes sense. Oddly enough about 1/2 way through my 2nd tank of juice the burnt taste went away. Would that be the cotton being fully absorbed with juice? 
 Could well be. Maybe it just wasn't fully saturated. 
 Before putting in a new coil, did you saturate the cotton in the new coil before trying to vape? 
If you didn't, the cotton might have burned seeing that there was no juice on the coil. 
When putting in a new coil, try dripping juice on the dry cotton, then really starting on a really low wattage and slowly moving higher and higher until you get back to your 38-45w. 
 Thank you:) No I didn't do that:( I thought letting the juice sit in the tank for a few minutes would do the trick. That makes sense though, lesson learned! I have so much to learn!  
 When you put a new coil into your tank and fill it with juice. After you have dripped some on the cotton then you can dry hit your tank 5-10 times with the mod off and that will help suck juice into the cotton.
I always do this before vaping on a new coil. 
 Ok cool I will try this next time I replace a coil. I want to switch to a RDA soon as soon as I get comfortable with my mod learn more:) Thanks 
 RDAs are alot of fun 
 They do look like fun! Just a little intimidated by them, what would good mod for a RDA setup? or does it matter? I think that's going to be my next purchase. I need to do some research! 
 For me i feel like the mod comes down to personal taste. I really enjoy using mech mods, so i use a Subohm Innovations Shorty Subzero Mech Mod with a Goon RDA.
But their is tons of different setups depending on what you like. Probably best not to get into mechs until you know enough about them to be safe. I would suggest maybe try to get a really good box. Maybe a Hex or Kraken or something. Ill provide some links that may help you find something you like. If you have any questions feel free to ask.

 There was a really great [post](https://www.reddit.com/r/electronic_cigarette/comments/4qa3nx/pico_internal_usb_charging_testing_and_analysis/) by /u/VapeyMcGyver where he tests the Eleaf Pico 75W USB charging capabilities (stick with me for a moment, the Pico is just an example).
He describes how the Pico has no dedicated charging circuitry so it recharges the battery by putting a maximum amperage (in the Pico's case about 902mA) through the USB port to charge the battery. Once it reaches 4.2V it holds it there by giving a constant charge. Through this method the battery gets charged and is held at the maximum cell voltage by feeding it just enough power to stay topped up.
The difference between USB charging and an external charger is that the external charger is circuitry *specifically designed* to charge the battery safely, which means it **will** be the best way to charge your battery. The way it does that is basically by monitoring the charge on the cell and what power it is putting in to it, following very specific guidelines on the ideal amounts of power for what charge is in the cell. At the end of its charging cycle the external charger drops to 0V, effectively disconnecting the battery from any source of input. The reason this is a **good** thing is because batteries generally dislike constant charging, though in this case the batteries won't really notice much difference. If you vape HARD on your batteries then charging with an external device will be 100% necessary both for cell longevity and safety, and your ability to always have a fresh cell without worrying about the quality degrading because you left it on a charger. 
tldr; internal battery charging is a blind power input to the battery, whereas external battery charging actively monitors charge levels and power inputs to maintain maximum battery life and quality. 
 Thanks for the mention! You got it spot on for the Pico, not so much for a recommendation in general ;) There are quite a few USB charging devices that perform a proper charge cut-off just like an external charger. Many have dedicated charge controller IC's similar to what you would find in an external charger which are also specifically designed to charge safely. I could even say that the DNA200 boards charge better than a lot of externals due to a selectable 4.10v/4.20v termination - the 4.10v setting is easier on your cells. There is also no relation with vaping hard and needing an external charger and even with a non-ideal float charging mod like the Pico there is no 100% requirement to charge externally. After leaving an eVic plugged in for 1 month straight I didn't find any noticeable capacity loss on the test cell. I do agree though that in the case of a float charging mod, using an external can be better (even though it's good practice to remove cells from any charger as soon as they are done) - as you said there's no worry about leaving the cells charging for too long. Of course that's provided your particular external does a good cut off ;) 
 Oo wow, so yeah that was a terrible 'general explanation' on my part. No research, serves me right. Thanks for clarifying though! I would have thought that the cells would degrade faster or require more attention if they were being discharged at higher amperages, but I suppose they're not as susceptible to thermal or physical damage from that? Is it that these mods just don't pull enough power to hurt their physical structure? 
 No worries at all! You made the correct conclusion based on what you read! Hope I didn't come off as a smartass ;) Cells can definitely be degraded by using them at a high discharge rate - the harder you run them the bigger the effect. I'm just not sure what that has to do with the charging method in your explanation. Can you explain a bit more?  
 You know more about this subject than I do so I think I'm the smartass here haha. I thought there may be some relationship between how hard a battery is discharged and how carefully you may want to charge it based on the physical condition of the battery. 
 Ahh I see. I'd never thought of it that way ;) There's no direct correlation that I know of - a cell can be degraded by a too  high rate of discharge or improper charging (current / voltage too high etc) but these effects would add up on their own. The only thing I can think of is letting the cell cool to room temp after a heavy discharge before recharging. In the case of charging internally, mods in general aren't really any less careful than an external charger. The main points are current rate, final voltage and charge termination. If we take the case of the Pico - the cell is being charged to a maximum of 4.20V with a current of around 800mA. Assuming you unplug it shortly after the cell is full since this particular mod float charges, the cell would have no idea it's being charged in a mod or in an external with a similar current setting. Actually if you had a snow wolf mini and an early version of the Efest LUC V4 (they charge a little too high at 4.26V), your cells would be quite a bit better off always being charged in the mod.
Hope this all makes sense! Always happy to answer more charging related questions if you have them! :) 
 Thanks for clearing that stuff up, it's been quite educational!:)

 So I've wondered this too, since I recently got into vaping. When I bought my mod in the shop the lady told me I needed an external charger soon or it would burn my battery out and possibly break my charge port. So I took this with a grain of salt and researched online. What I found is that it charges batteries much faster, and is easier on your mod because the device doesn't have to channel the energy from the wall to the battery. It's also less stress on that battery too.There are even some vapes that only have the USB port for software updates and you have to have an external charger. I'm about to buy an external charger and some extra 18650s.  
 The vast majority of mods with external charging that have multiple batteries do not have balanced charging. 
 [deleted] 
 Yes they will. The mod will charge and discharge them at different rates. 
 Oh I didn't read your comment right my bad. 
 The solution to this is just to swap the battery positions regularly. 
EDIT: I'm a liar don't trust me.  
 This actually doesn't help! 
 No? Why not? My logic is that if one cradle dis/charges at a different rate than the others, switching your batteries around would result in them being pretty evenly dis/charged on average if that makes sense?
I'm genuinely interested. 
EDIT: I read some of your comment history! Neat! 
 Sorry, I should have explained instead of just throwing one line at you! Was in a rush to get to work :) So imagine the two cells in a loop (series) kinda like sections of the same length of garden hose. Assuming the hose can't leak, all the water must flow equally through the first half of its length as it will through the second half. You can't just somehow lose water along the way or have less water flowing in one half. It's the same regardless of which direction the water is flowing which compares to charge or discharge. Even if there is a kink in the hose (bad connection between cells) the same amount of water still flows through each half, just slower. There is one thing that complicates this theory slightly - there is a voltage sense tap in between the cells. In this case it's like having a pressure sensor connected in the middle of the hose. This sensor again ideally doesn't leak or divert any water however the equivalent electronic circuit does have a tiny current draw. It's very small though and pretty much irrelevant. I'm doing some more testing to confirm this for sure. The main cause of cells becoming unbalanced is the small variation in actual capacity and self-discharge rate from cell to cell. Hope this all made sense, please let me know if it didn't! 
 How neat is that... 
 This is a myth ;) In a series configuration it is impossible to charge or discharge cells at different rates. The cells themselves unbalance due to minor differences in their capacity and leakage rates. 
 That's true although I believe balance charging in mods is overrated unless you plan on solely charging by USB. So far I've only seen a difference of 0.02V from the starting voltages after a week of charging in non-balancing mods. It does seem like more devices are offering balance charging lately. 
 There have always been old wives' tales where all sorts of strange claims were said to be true.  This is one of them.  Every good quality name brand mod uses an excellent charge controller inside the device to charge the battery.  Low cost external chargers do not use a controller that is any better.  Laboratory grade chargers costing upwards of $2000 do have better control circuitry and are a slightly better way to charge cells.  Always use the lab-type charger if you have it. 
 Charging externally will give a better/fuller charge. Yes, you can charge your device through the micro USB however, that USB port is generally used from software updates. 
 Just to let you know, for the most part the mods I've tested charge to the same voltage as externals. 
 Although this may be true. I've found that charging externally will give a fuller charge in the long run. Charging through the USB port shortens the battery longevity in my experience. 
 Out of interest, what mods and external charger have you been using? 
 It's a combination of misinformation (or lack of information), old wives tales and myths. I started testing USB charging partly because of this exact question. The problem is that the USB charge function of these mods is often overlooked and finding hard data is next to impossible. The reviewers simply don't have all the information at hand that would allow them to make a recommendation so they default to recommending external charging. While It's definitely true that some mods charge better than others, I'm yet to find a device which is properly unsafe to use the USB charge function on. 
 Thank you for all the information you've posted!
I guess what  really comes down to, personally, is this:  I LIKE the connivence of charging in the mod via USB.  I'm okay with charging externally, but given the choice, I'd rather just plug her in.  
And, specifically, my ideal situation would be to charge via computer USB, while at my desk at work during the day while not in use.  
Mods/kits i have right now and/or am looking at getting are the Innokin Coolfire IV, Vaporesso Target Mini, Smok Osub 40w, (those three have internal battery) and the Asmodus Ohmsmium (the one 18650 removable on my list).  I really shouldn't have to worry about it with any of these, right? 
 Hey no worries! Sorry that I kinda hijacked your thread with all the replies! Obviously USB charging is a subject close to my heart ;) 
I totally agree with you, I prefer to just plug a device in to charge too. I've never been a fan of yanking batteries out to charge them when there is a perfectly usable charge circuit inside the mod. It's especially a pain having to put them back in when I'm half asleep and late for work in the morning.
In your case, charging from USB sounds like the way to go. Normally a PC output is only 500mA but that'll be fine since you can plug it in anytime during the day. Keep in mind that it may not be best for the battery to keep it constantly plugged in and at full charge. A lithium cell will generally degrade quicker if it spends a lot of time at full charge. This may or may not have much of an effect in the normal time a mod lasts though. Regardless, I'd probably use the mod until the battery is about half full before plugging in then unplug once charged. You can't really get into trouble with any of the mods when using it this way. As a side note, it's a good idea to check where the port location is on each mod. Down lower when the mod is standing up is better as the socket doesn't have to hold as much cable weight. Batteries can last a very long time but you'll be stuffed if the port breaks!
I haven't tested any of the mods in your list unfortunately. The Innokin T18 I tested did great charging as well as the Asmodus Snow Wolf mini so hopefully they've kept using the same type of circuitry in their other mods. I wasn't too impressed with the SMOK Alien charging but it's a completely different device than the Osub. I haven't tested anything from vaporesso.
Hope this helps! Feel free to ask any more Q's :) 
 While I have your attention :) ...what are your thoughts on using phone wall chargers?  (iPhone, to be exact) 
 Completely fine! Wall adaptors (and everything else with a USB socket) aren't actually chargers - they're just straight 5V DC power supplies. The only difference is how much current each one is rated at. It's entirely up to the device plugged in how it uses that 5V to charge. 
 And from what I understand, devices pull only what they need?
Thanks again for all your help in answering my questions and calming my fears :) 
 That's right, the only time the power supply has any effect is when its maximum current capability is less that what the device wants to draw in which case the supply would be the limiting factor. Most welcome! 
 battery's charged through an external charger is safe. charging through a usb port thats mostly an after thought by the get it done by the lowest cost chinese manufacturing market is way off the deep end of dangerous.  
 I wouldn't classify any of the mods I have tested so far as unsafe let alone off the deep end of dangerous! Also you may be interested to know that some models of the popular Efest LUC V4 technically overcharge at 4.26v/cell. Also, most external chargers come from China too! It's not always as black and white as saying externals are safe and mods aren't. 
 I'd recommend an Innokin Endure T18, battery isn't bad although you might want 2, I've hit it pretty hard for most of the day before, silent when you're drawing on it.
Take a look and see what you think, there'll be loads of room in the budget for at least 3 batteries if you want them, maybe a couple of different tanks to easily swap out flavours. Buy coils online it should be about $10 for 5 and they last about a week at the least. 
 5 coils last 1 week? is this common for all coils? 
 Sorry that's meant to mean a week each! 
 There are lots of choices these days and almost any name brand gear will be able to deliver satisfying puffs of nicotine.  My first device was an iStick mini 10 watt with an Aspire K1 tank and 1.6 ohm coil.  My first juice was 12 mg/ml cigarette flavoured and I vaped it at around 3.6 volts.  It worked great but now I have moved on to a device with temperature control.  My first mod still works fine as a reliable source of nicotine. 
 what is the benefit of temp control? how often do you need to replace coils on the iStick? 
 Temperature control devices automatically adust the power (wattage) to maintian a constant coil temperature.  They have the most consistent output and usually won't burn the wicking in the atomizer when the tank runs dry.  The next best thing is adjustable wattage.  Those mods adjust the voltage to maintain a constant power output.  It takes a half second or so for the coil to come up to temperature but the output is quite consistent after that.  The next step down are variable voltage devices.  The voltage can be set to a constant value which the power pack maintains.  As coils age their resistance often increases and the voltage needs to be increased to maintain constant power output.  At the bottom are unregulated mods that are basically just a battery and a switch.  Those are non adustable and produce more power when they are fully charged than when they are completely discharged.  Changing power output of an unregulated mod requires a coil with a different resistance.  Power output from  unregulated mods drops about 20% over the day so they are completely usable.
TC is generally better than VW which is better than VV which is better than unregulated.
The iStick doesn't have a coil.  It just supplies power to the Aspire tank which contains an atomizer with a coil and wicking material inside.  My coils last about six weeks using unflavoured liquid at 5 watts.  Their life will be shorter when used with flavoured juice and/or at higher power levels. 
 back when I was using my old setup I was using aspire bdc et-s tanks with that exact same 1.6 ohm coil with flavored juice running at 11 watts and the coils lasted me a 4-6 weeks. aspire knows how to make good tanks and good coils for beginners. It really just depends on the individual. 
 Yes I also have an Aspire ET-S tank in blue and it is a good device.  The only problem I have had is that it leaks juice when I do not get the top sealed air tight when I reassemble it after cleaning.  You just know a beginner is not going to get it sealed either.  
The K-1 is glued at the top and does not come apart so I have never had a leak at the top.  That is why I did not mention the ET-S even though it is an excellent little tank.   
 My only problem with the k1 was the fact that I couldn't take it apart fully. I had put some incredibly may juice in mine once and I had to stop using it because I couldn't clean the flavor out 
 Aspire has something like  a half dozen tanks that take the small BVC atomizer with Kanthal wire coil.  The Aspire Mini Vivi Nova in glass looks interesting and I have been trying to find the Aspire Mini E-pen tank for months.  Aspire offers some excellent low-priced tanks. 
 People tend to find PDO to be a lot smoother but it's really down to personal preference, I suppose you could say traditional VG based is more of the norm or more popular than PDO, but it's really down to you. 
TLDR: It doesn't matter which you choose but I'd personally go for VG. 
 Okay thanks! Looking at this https://wizardlabs.us/index.php?route=product/product&product_id=1289&search=Mint would it be fine? 
 Yeah mix that with some premixed vg/pg and you should be golden :) 
 My first and only mix so far is a Real Flavors eliquid (the ingredients say Natural extracts and flavors in Alcohol OR Vegetable Glycerin), RF Watermelon and Strawberry (5% each)  At week two it may have had an off-taste but at week three it's really good. It also has FA Coconut at 3%, and Erythritol 2%. 
 Just use Liquid Barn man. 
 Try filling with all airflow cut off. Close your airflow and fill up 
 What tacothekid said for a leaks from the air holes. As for spit back I like to take a napkin wrap it around the airflow and hold the mod upside down and blow tru the driptip a few times. Also i find when your not vaping you should close the airflow off as it helps keep it from leaking. 
 Ah okay, I'll try those things, thanks man! I'll probably be back here with no luck or another problem haha 
 Yeah I have a tfv4 and had the same problem at frist and these 3 things helped a lot.  
 Try only filling to the top of coil each time and see if that eases the leaking - mine leaks from O-ring connecting the chimney to the coil :( 
 Ah okay, thanks for the tip, I'll try this at the same time 
 If it's going to sit for a bit (more than a day)close the airflow.  That's the problem. 
 Maybe he could try a tobacco flavored eliquid  
 First of all stop trying to force your brother to conform to your beliefs.  Do you honestly think you are the first person to try and make him quit smoking?    Anti-smoker bigots have been crawling out of the woodwork for more than fifty years and they are everywhere.  
I no longer smoke and over time I have accumulated some vaping gear.  Now I have the Aspire K-1 and Nautus mini, Cubis, and Vaporesso Guardian tanks.  They all work great but it is the cheap old K-1 that is most like a cigarette.  Using that one at 5 or 6 watts with 12 mg/ml cigarette flavoured fluid is the closest thing to smoking a tobacco cigarette that I have experienced since I quit smoking.  
By the way, today I normally vape 20 mg/ml unflavoured juice at 340 degree F.    
 i understand where you are coming from but i wouldn't go as far as to say im trying to force him to quit. although i would love for him to make the switch i know i cant force him to do it. all i can do is try to find a setup that works for him and i will continue to do that until he tells me he doesnt want to keep trying. i will look into getting a k-1 for him to try with higher mg nic. thank you for the advice and letting me know what worked for you.  
 It is likely that you do not understand where I am coming from because I have many decades of experience that you do not yet have.  When I started smoking in '69 about two out of three adults in North America smoked some form of tobacco.  When I switched to vaping about 16 months ago the number of people still smoking had fallen to something like two in thirty.  That is an 85% reduction in the rate of smoking over the past fifty years but there has been no significant reduction in smoking related disease.  That means THR (Tobacco Harm Reduction) is a complete myth so stop nagging your brother about it.
What is real is that vaping is cheaper and more convenient than smoking.  Vaping can provide the same amount of nicotine for a fraction of the price.  The cost can be as low as pennies per day for people that blend their own juice.  Vaping is more convenient than smoking because there are no ashes and the devices can start and stop producing vapour instantly with no chance of starting a fire.  When I go shopping with my wife at an outdoor mall I can take a puff or two as we walk between stores and that was never possible with real cigarettes. Good luck to you and your brother.  
 > Talking to him tday its more about the tobacco flavor to him.
He might legitimately think that, but it?s not true. Well, it?s not *strictly* true. There?s more to cigarettes than the flavor, and vaping doesn?t come close to delivering all the chemicals we crave from tobacco.
> What setup out there most relates to the combustion of burning tobacco feel and taste?
The JUUL is the closest thing I?ve found to a real cigarette. Not in terms of flavor (there?s nothing that comes close to a real cigarette in terms of flavor, as far as I?ve seen at least), but in terms of throat hit and immediacy of satisfaction. 
> Is there hope to get him to make the change by finding him a set up or will he just smoke cigarettes until it kills him?
Hard to say. How long has he been smoking? If it hasn?t been that long, then he probably doesn?t have a reason to quit other than knowing that it?s potentially harmful and theoretically bad news. I know when I was smoking for only a few years, I hadn?t experienced any negative consequences from it. No chronic cough, or noticeable decrease in stamina or pain in my chest or anything like that. It took many many years for all of that to develop and convince me to quit.   
 It's never a lost cause. I struggled to find the perfect setup and juices for three years. I'm smoke free 3 months. I think. I stopped counting days after the first week, which was rough every time. (I quit probably 40 times over the 3 years, each horrifically unsuccessful!) This time though... I had what I needed and the transition was pretty easy. Don't ever give up. When he is ready and he finds his perfect setup, he'll know.  
 Which one of the pens do you have? Theres one with adjustable wattage on the bottom, and one without.
If you have the bigger one, turn up the watts. 
 It's the one without wattage control. 
 This won't help with the clouds, but it may help with the leaky air vents. When you take a hit, do you keep pulling at all after you let go of the button? If not, start doing that. 
If you don't, vapor will stay in the tank, recondense in the vents, and eventually leak out. 
Edit: Also, if the mod uses removable batteries, the rule of thumb is to charge them externally.  
 I will keep that in mind thanks. 
Yeah I need to order one. It should be 99% safe to carry e-cig in an empty pocket right? I doubt it could turn on by itself as it needs to be pressed 5 times. TBH images of people who got burned by a busted battery are kinda stuck in my head to the point I can't vape without stress like if this thing explodes in my face for whatever reason I am done for. It's like having a kid, I have to be extra cautious all the time. 
When I first got it I didn't know carrying ecig in a full pocket is asking for a trouble, I learned that now but I am still inexperienced with ecigs and even though I've read a lot guides about safety, there might be something that I am missing, or maybe I might forget something when in a hurry. I guess I am just ranting I didn't know what I am signing up for, it was supposed to be fun and easy way to quit smoking but instead it makes me paranoid lol
 
 Empty pocket is fine. Just take it out when you sit down. I usually carry mine in either my back pocket, or front shirt pocket. Most people who have hurt themselves with batteries could have been easily avoided. 
Buy quality batteries. Check out Mooch's reviews on /r/electronic_cigarettes to figure out which ones you need. Typically go with LG, Sony, or Samsung. 
Charge them externally with a quality charger. They're pretty cheap. No real reason not to. 
Keep the wraps and insulators in good condition, and don't damage the battery. If a battery is physically damaged, just toss it. It's not worth the risk. You can get spare battery wraps and insulators very cheaply and they're easy to put on. Just check that sub I mentioned above for sources. 
Lastly, if using multi-battery mods, look up battery marrying on that same sub. Lurking that sub will really teach you everything you need to know to vape safely.  
 Bump, I can taste burnt taste so I am guessing the coil is burned. BUT HOW THE HELL DID THAT HAPPEN? It was a new replacement coil provided with the kit. I didn't do anything to it except priming.
JEEEEEEESUUUUUUUUSSSSSSSSSSSSSSS 
 I (almost) always use 50/50 juices. Good to mention that I also enjoy cold vape so I usually go up to 35-40W depending on the atomizer. I mainly use 0.3 and 0.5 coils on a Uwell Crown and TFV4 micro. For temp control I have a Cleito with its 0.4 coils and I run it at 110C max. This is my experience and the setup I prefer but I guess it depends a lot on your own taste and definitely on the setup you use. 
 no, it's 6mg of nicotine per 1ml of liquid.  
 This is why companies should always list the full mg/ml or percentage (or both).  
 From 1969 until about 16 months ago I smoked cigarettes but switched to vaping for ETR (Excessive Tax Reduction).  At first I vaped 12 mg/ml cigarette flavoured juice at 8 watts.  Now I vape 20 mg/ml unflavoured juice at 5 watts.  The shops prefer you vape lots of dishwater-strength liquid at high power so they can sell you more juice, coils, and batteries.  
Your bottle contains 6 mg nicotine per ml of liquid.  A 10 ml bottle would contain 60 mg of nicotine which is roughly equivalent to 60 cigarettes.   
 I thought there was something fishy about the sales clerk's insistence that 80 watts is best on a device, and that I'll need to replace the coil regularly. When I got it home, any setting over 35 watts produced a coughing fit. 
 Thanks. My brain was having hiccups trying to find an equivalency. 
 You are welcome.  If your mod is the OSUB Plus then the specifications indicate the power output can vary from 1 watt to 80.  That means it can do almost anything a user might want it to.  From what I read the OSUB can also do temperature control.  My newest mod does TC with stainless steel coils.  It works really well.  All I do is set my temperature to 340 degrees F and it handles all the necessary adjustments.   
 Are you a heavy smoker?  Like, pack a day regular marlboro?  With sub ohm vaping, 6mg sounds about right for a starter.  If you find yourself getting dizy or nic sick (headache, queasy) drop to 3mg nic.   
 I accidently responded on the main page, but thanks for these responses. I feel dumb now but enlightened, thanks for your answers. I'm actually a 2 pack a day Marlboro reds smoker, so the guy said 6mg was a good start. My device came with a little instruction booklet that is very small and I think roughly translated from perhaps Chinese lol. All the settings, wattage, ohms, all seems confusing. Know of any good website referral to explain like I'm the old timer I am? I google but ads ads ads ads made me give up. 
 >I'm actually a 2 pack a day Marlboro reds smoker, so the guy said 6mg was a good start.  
Don't know why he would say that. Friend of mine (2 pack a day smoker) started out with 24mg/ml. I was a 10 cig a day smoker and started on 12mg. If you go too low, you'll just end up chain vaping all day or going back to cigarettes. There's really no danger of overdosing, your brain will tell you when you've had enough. Worst case, you'll get a jittery feeling and a slight headache for 2 hours. 
 Yes! Thanks. On the second day now I've been vaping continuously, enjoying it but definitely needing and extra kick. Kind of disgruntled that he convinced me to only get 6mg but lesson learned.  
 If you go and buy a bottle of 24 mg/ml in the same flavour then you can mix the two to get any strength between 6 and 24.  I buy 24 and then add a small amount of PG and VG to get 20.  Mixing equal amounts of 6 and 24 will give 15 and that strength is really nice at low to moderate power levels. 
 I think the sidebar of this sub has good info, I'm on mobile so can't see. Anyhow wattage is how much power your putting through, ohms/resistance mainly affects the ramp up time of getting that power through generally speaking lower ohms also means you can run higher power and produce more vapor. PG/VG will also affect this. More VG=more vapor, more PG= more flavor and throat hit. Nicotine is measured mg/ml usually, with a sub ohm tank you want lower nic generally, try to stay under 12 most people prefer 3-6 though, but you can go higher. If you want more of a mouth to lung (cigarette like) vape you can get a non sub ohm tank, keep in mind you'll also need higher nicotine juice like 12-18mg since they produce less vapor, some people like them a lot though. You can also try keeping the airflow only partially open on a subohm set up and run higher ohm coils at lower wattage for that mouth to lung style vape.  
 I was a pack a day might night's smoker and 12 gives me a buzz. I think 6 would be good for me too lol 
 Your ohms should be auto regulated by the mod. Check the box for the recommended wattage for your tank or just google it, then stay within that range.  Make sure you know what coil you are using. If you have a smok mod I believe they have an app on the App Store called vaping tour where you can connect your mod if it has Bluetooth then you can change the settings in there, much easier than on the mod itself.  
 I've had Sub and Toptanks and they're no worse for leaking than anything else really. I don't know much about the Smok but if you're looking at the other two in kit form you have the following problems - Innokin: mod is great, tank it comes with is a 6/10. Kanger - tank is good, mod is a janky piece of crap. Remember as well with a Kanger it's an external battery, so go over to /r/ecr and read Mooch's battery safety bits if you're not familiar.  
 I have a topbox and I love it, I've never had an issue with leaking. My guess is that people get confused with the top-fill feature. If you fill it all the way up and don't leave a little air bubble it will leak because it is unable to tolerate pressure changes. Bottom fill tanks all have air bubbles in them by design.
The topbox is great because the tank comes with a little RBA, a rebuild-able coil, which is absurdly easy to use and very cheap. It has a removeable battery, so you can keep a spare and charge one while using the other.
The Innoken is great because it is often possible to [buy it with the tank of your choice](http://www.myvaporstore.com/Innokin-Coolfire4-TC100W-Aethon-Chip-Express-p/ink-cf440.htm), it wasn't released as a set kit. It has an internal battery and that can be a bonus for some people, however if you want to use and RDA and vape at 60+ watts you'll find the battery life isn't that great. None of these mods have great battery life at that wattage, but with the kanger I can at least swap out the battery for a new one when it goes flat.
If you want simple and no hastle, the innoken with a toptank is a pretty good combo imo 
 I've been a fan of Innokin after buying a few MVPs, but the TC 100 is just not up to par. Check out r/Innokin for more details (including my post if you dig far enough). The iSub V tank has a tendency to expel its entire contents (with a properly fitted top cap and secure o-rings), and the mod itself seems to have some production issues (mine would just shut off and become unresponsive for no reason). I'm not personally familiar with your other choices, but I would definitely caution you on the TC 100.  
 My wife's only issue with the Smok R80 kit is the magnetic battery door is weak.  She put a silicone case on it and loves it. 
 First off you'll need some wire, 24/26g Kanthal is pretty standard to start off with.
Some cotton (organic at least), I would recommend Cotton Bacon.
Something to cut your wire nice and close to the post.
Some ceramic tweezers would be a real bonus so you can get your coils glowing evenly.
To make your coil you should use a coil jig or you could just use a screwdriver of say 3mm diameter, many options out there.
My best suggestion is look online for a coil building kit, the Coilmaster 3 has everything but probably more than you need.
Oh and you can find lots of tools online (search for steam engine) which will help you find the predicted resistance (ohms) of the build you plan to make.
Lastly some patience, it's tricky at first but after a few goes you'll be fine, watch some videos on building and wicking as well and if you have any issues then anyone here will happily help :) 
 Yup, good answer from Hickerytick :) 
 If you order everything online(I highly recommend everything listed above) but really want to get started while waiting, you can get a 20-25' length of wire and 10 or so sheets of organic cotton from a B&M for around $10 (at least the ones in my area.)  Really small craft wire nippers(or nail clippers) are an ok substitute for flush cutters while you wait.  Small needle nose pliers can be used to adjust mounted coils while you wait for ceramic tweezers, just don't use them while firing!  Reason for ceramic tips is that they are nonconductive, so you can adjust coils while firing so they cool and remain in the position you want them.  I use a fire extinguisher pin that is 3mm as a coil jig. 
 Some of the newer mods monitor battery voltage when loaded and stop firing if the cell cannot handle the load.  Does your cell meet the surge current requirement of the mod?  One thing that might help is to lower the preheat wattage and see if that helps. 
 Could be the battery not having enough charge. Or the box detects too much heat.
 try a different atty on it. see if you still get the same problem 
 My Dripbox did the same after 4 months. I gave up and went back to a tube mod. The tanks are average and ok, but I just can't seem to get a good mod from them anymore.  
 The lemo is made for MTL vaping, or mouth to lung vaping. Mainly, it is meant for 50/50 blends and high nic juice. Max VG is going to be too much for it, as is anything above 70 VG. You're coils aren't getting the juice since it is too thick. Try a lower VG juice at a higher resistance. Try 8 wraps 26ga instead. Higher gauge wire at a high resistance will work better, especially with higher PG juice.  
 more VG = less taste most of the time, and yeah, juice is too thick 
 Use the I Sub G with a 0.5ohm coil at 20watts and try a 70/30 VG liquid.

You'll be surprised by how many different mods you can buy for �40, ukecigstore have some shops dotted around, so you don't need to buy online.
I can't fault my Coolfire 4 Plus though, I've had it for AGES and it still works reliably.
Just recently bought a Wismec D30 (fancied something different) direct from;
 https://www.joyetech.co.uk/e-cig-kits.html 
..and the thing is built like a fucking tank! the D30 battery is only �27 btw.

Try not to juice it up as much as he did (looked like his well was filled to the top of the airflow holes). I'd also suggest pulsing after saturating the coils like he did. Whether you have aliens or not. What that will do is allow the juice to soak into the compressed cotton under the coil itself.
P.s. I couldn't live without unlimited data. That sucks. 
 Hey :) 
I can't recommend a good videos but I can give you my experience as I have a Tsunami 24 myself.
A good start build could be the following:
-Kanthal 24 Ga wire dual coil
-Go for 7 full wraps each around 2.5mm screw
-Should get to around 0.3ohm
-Wick it with enough cotton so that its fits in tightly in the coil and long enough for it to hang down to the floor of the dripper
Drop a couple squirts on your cotton and wire, wait a bit and try :)
Should be a good start 
 Find a couple of Rubber bands, the Thick ones. when you have a tank that is stuck wrap a rubber band around it and then use the rubber band to unscrew the tank. The rubber band will give lots of grip without putting so much force that you break a tank. And never ever set foot in that god awful shop again 
 >how can I a) never have to walk in one of these stores again
Unless you want to shop online only, which means you can't taste any of the juice before you buy it, you can't.  I have bought juice I've never tried before online, and one of them was so bad I gagged every time I hit it.  I burned out the juice, and put better juice in, and I could still taste the windex flavor of the first one.  I had to ultimately replace the cotton and the coil and wash my RDA before I could vape again.  Basically I don't recommend buying anything online you haven't already tried and enjoyed.
#HOWEVER
You should never ever go back in to *that* store again.  Don't ever give them your money, unless they decide to somehow make this.  Like perhaps if you wrote a nasty review or made a facebook post on their store page describing your experience.
#MORE HOWEVER
Once you find a few flavors that you LOVE, buy them online.  They will usually be way cheaper, and you can get the amount (bigger bottle usually = less $ per mL), the exact VG/PG, and nic level that you want.  There's an awesome crunch berries juice that I buy religiously online in 30mL + from Puff Vapors, and I save usually between 30-50% when I do so.
In the mean time, find another store around the area, one with decent reviews online preferably, and **tell them about your experience at the other store**.  Tell them how rudely you were treated, how they broke your shit, and then wouldn't pay for it.  I also think that they wouldn't have dared pull that shit on a dude in most instances, so if you feel similarly, mention that sexist shit too (you'd know better about this than I would).  Explain your noobie status, and are trying to find a place willing to teach you, and not take advantage of you.
Doing this doesn't mean you're going to get any sweet deals, or employees who treat you better than the last store (even though they *might*), but it gives them an idea of what you are and not looking for as a customer.  It gives them a road map about how to get, and retain you as a customer.
Ideally, there will be *at least* one store in your area that you feel safe and not taken advantage of during your patronage.  If so, try flavors, try flavors, try flavors.  Sample sample sample, then buy small bottles to dry on your mod at home (the flavor will be much more tasty/noticeable).
Then, once you find enough flavors you like (or hell just one that you love), you will only have to go in to these stores to buy a bottle when you realized you forgot to place your online order in time and the mail hasn't come yet.
#SIDE NOTE:
I definitely recommend either A: getting and RDA for your top box, or better yet B: trying this guy out as a starter kit http://www.myvaporstore.com/Kangertech-Dripbox-Starter-Kit-p/krdb10.htm
I just got it and it's kind of the best of both worlds in terms of RDA, or tanking.  You can drip on it, or you can fill the squeeze tank with juice and it shoots up in to the RDA to wet the wick.
Mainly this is because an RDA flavor is like lightyears better than the prebuilt things that come with the tanks for the topbox (I owned it previously).
AND, you can buy prebuilt coil/wick for the RDA on that one, or you can rebuild them yourself.
Anyway, I'm not expert by any means, but I have been vaping for about a year now and have been building my own coils now for about months.  So I'll help any way that I can. If not me, someone on this sub will probably be able to help you.
Also, sorry to hear about those dicks.  Don't give them your money any more.
Edit:
Thought I'd mention that with the mod I linked you have much less control over wattage than you do with the top box.  It's a 60W I believe, but you can lower it manually (not digitally) with a dial on the bottom of the battery housing.  Just so you know.  It's the biggest downside I've found with it. 
 That's some good advise. I've only been lurking here a few days to learn exactly this kind of stuff! Now to learn what RDA means haha 
 Just ask dude! Rebuildable Drip Atomizer.  It screws in to the same spot a tank would screw into (as long as it is the correct size, stanard is 510 thread).  It usually has 2+ posts, and you build your own coils to fit those posts giving you 2 or more wicks (depending on how many posts your RDA has).
With RDA there is no leaking unless you over fill the well and tip it over.  The downside is that you have to drip juice on it every 5-10 hits or so.  However, alot of people look at this as a plus because they can switch juice about that much so they can use different flavors with more frequency.
Alot of people don't like the hassle of rebuilding your coils and wicking yourself, but it really isn't hard and the more you do it the better/faster you get at it.
With *that* said, that's why that new kanger is so cool.  It's like a tank mod and a mod with an RDA had a beautiful baby.  Great for beginners but probably not so much for experienced users who want crazy sweet cLoWdZ^^^^TM. 
 Thanks man! I've been Vaping nearly 2 weeks now. Started with a pen type and bought myself a Kanger Topbox Nano a few days ago but was tempted to go for the Kanger you're talking about. Had to slow myself down so I didn't take on too much too quick. Still not really sure what i'm doing but i'm going to make a post here asking for help. Don't want to high jack someone elses post! 
 Send me a pm when you post that in case I miss your post on my front page.  Like I said, I'm newish too but I'll help however I can.
 I wish someone would have given me this kind of advice when I first started vaping.  
 Wow.  Like I said, I'm not super experienced by any stretch and I threw this post together while killing time in my last 20 minutes of work. So, that's actually quite a compliment to me. Thank you.
There should really be a wiki or something on this sub.  Or maybe a stickied thread, or day of the week, where noobies ask questions and the community helps answer them. 
 Just wanted to say, great post. 
 Thanks dude.  I hope OP thinks so too and it works out for her.  Real shitty when sketchy vape shops turn new people away from a nice hobby. 
 Hey I wanted to mention one more thing about your mod.  I had an issue with it leaking too (not uncommon for that mod btw) and it was driving me crazy.  None of the things I found online to mitigate it worked for long or at all.  That's what prompted me to buy the RDA.  The coolest thing about the drip box was that it had the functionality of a tank, but NO DRIPPING.  Really wish I had started with that one.
And again, drop me a line if you have any more questions or issues and maybe we can help. 
 Hey,
I work at a vape shop, and our policy if we break a customer's glass is to give them a new piece of glass. It's why I usually hand the customer their tank and the pliers, or use plastic tools to take the thing apart. What happened to you was super shitty. Try a different shop.  
 I wouldn't recommend taking the voltage past 5 volts.
The voltage changes depending on the resistance of the coil, so just adjust the wattage to something below 5. I enjoy 4 volts or so.  
 The beauty of transactive information is that google will tell you everything you know, any time you need it. Www.steam-engine.com will basically do all the thinking for you. Although it does have a learning curve, playing around a little bit should clarify most things. Thing is, and I don't mean to be rude, you can totally get away with not understanding ohms law if you were using tanks with pre build coils, But if you're making your own coils, having a general Idea will help, A LOT.  I'm dyslexic, but I make it work. Don't expect others to do the thinking for you. 
 iJust 2 / iJust S. Subohm direct to lung. eGo AIO with 0.5 ohm coils can do DTL too, although its 2ml built-in tank could be a bit too small. On a plus side, AIO is really small and leak-proof. 
 Thanks for the suggestions. I like the look of the iJust S :] Decisions decisions 
 Eleaf icare is pretty dope 
 Just got an icare for my girlfriend and it is an awesome little (really little) mod. It actually has decent airflow and is a good vape for the price. You can just get the mod without the useless charging station for $15 or less 
 Kangertech subvod is a cool kit. Replaceable coils as it comes with a top tank nano. It's a fixed 3.7V output though so if you want variable settings it wouldn't work all that well for you.
Edit: oh and the coils are 0.6ohm 
 In early August I received a Vaporesso Target mini box mod with the Guardian tank.  It works well but is a little box mod and not a pen.  Joyetech makes a fat pen type kit with variable wattage called the eGo Mega Twist+ kit but it has fewer adjustments than the Target mini.  Whatever you buy make sure it has adjustable power output so you do not get stuck with a fixed output that is not right for you. 
 It could be the nicotine strength you are using. It's hard to give advice if you're unsure what it tastes like but the nicotine can make you cough and sometimes has a peppery taste. 
It could also be a really bad juice you're using.  
 I always have been using three. I'm starting to think if it is the juice. I had the same bottle for about a month now. That's same amount of time I have had my mod also. This would be the second time I have had my atomizer changed 
 I can honestly say that without a doubt cheap juice made with cheap nicotine is to be the culprit of many a bad tasting vape hit. Try a different juice, if that doesn't resolve the issue, swap out the atomizer. Sometimes you just get a bad batch. 
 I have two Uwell Crowns (since I thought the first one was a dud) and after burning out THIRTEEN COILS between them (I'm one of those stupid people who keep trying things that fail) I gave up. Never had a coil last a week. Suckfest.  
 Sounds like the cooked cotton aftertaste that I always had with new coils on my tfv4.  Start at a lower wattage and ramp it up to break in the coil.  OR power through it.  If it's the same issue I dealt with it should clear out after 8-10 good pulls. 
 In a word YES 
 Hella 
 Never buy any vaping gear from unknown online sources.  There is a lot of fake gear available and some of it is dangerous because the lithium cell could vent in your face.  If the price is too good to be true then the device is probably a fake although some crooks sell the fakes for more than the real thing.  These criminals do not care if their customers need reconstructive surgery and they certainly won't pay for any of it. 
 would you say that the one im getting is a fake?
 To be a fake they would have to claim it is a name brand and they do not claim anything like that.  It is just generic stuff from an unknown source.  Try visiting a real vaping shop and see how much an adjustable voltage Joyetech, Kanger, or Vision ego-type battery and Aspire K-1 tank will cost.  That is the absolute minimum that I would buy. 
 Heat draws the juice towards it. Normally I get popping when my watts are too low. My guess is the coil isn't vaporizing the juice fast enough and its over saturating. 
 I tried bumping it up to 65 and 70 but I lost that smooth draw. I'm sure I'll find that happy medium though. Thanks for the tip/info. I highly recommend Lighthouse cape fear btw...nice strawberry custard flavor!  
 Oh, interesting...it's an extremely smooth draw right now. So I'll try bumping the watts up a bit higher. I went up to 60 but I'll try ramping it up incrementally to see how that affects the pop... 
 So I got my TF-RTA wicked and filled. The draw on it is SUPER smooth. After 2-3 draws, the coil pops like a bubble with each draw. 
When I was wicking the stock coils, I didn't know how wide to cut the cotton (cotton bacon) and I'm wondering if I went too thick. I've got my Alien set to 50w in normal mode. 
Suggestions? Videos I should watch?
Edit: just watched a bunch of wicking videos on YouTube. Definitely heavy handed on the cotton. Once I empty the tank, I think I'll re-wick it.  
 Update, lost half a tank of juice to it leaking out the air intake. I filled it half-way and closed the juice feed and air intake then put it in a shot glass and went to bed. 
Woke up this morning and the tank is oozing ever so slightly from the air intake. I'm scared to open the intake haha 
 Make sure that none of the cotton is covering the air flow of when you are wicking. When I bought my first RTA I accidentally did this and it leaked so bad I could barely even vape it.  
 Yeah my first wick (which I'll be re-doing tonight) consisted of me cutting an entire strip the width of the coil and fishing it through the coil. After watching videos on how to wick...which should have been step 1...I now know it's not meant to be the entire thickness of the pad...#facepalm 
 Lol trust me RTA are like the hardest thing to wick in my opinion but after a while you get the hang of it! 
 Well I just finished my second attempt. Took the cotton and spread it out like a Scottish roll trimmed it a bit the rolled it up. I fluffed the ends out and tucked the in. One of the four ends hung down into the juice well slightly but it wasn't too bad so I left it. I only put one dropper of fluid in and it's sitting in a shot glass for another hour to test for leaks. 
When I removed the old cotton, it was the thickness of a gummy worm soaked in ejuice...definitely too much cotton that run! 
 Lol I know the feeling. I hope everything goes well! 
 Look up Scottish Roll, and watch some videos on it. Best wicking technique to date. I don't have that RTA but when my Aromamizer starts leaking I find that I haven't put enough cotton in there. It's about finding the balance between covering the juice flow holes with the wick ends while allowing enough to flow into the wick.  
 I checked a couple vids on that but they all used cotton squares. I don't have it in front of me at the moment, and I didn't really study it when I cut some off last night. Can you do a Scottish roll w/cotton bacon?
If I get home and try before you respond, I'll update you on my attempt! 
 I don't use cotton bacon but it looks like it is all ready to go as a wick. So to fix your leaking issues you just need to get the right amount of cotton in there. I like to have the ends of my wick touch the build deck and juice holes. Much longer than that and you will restrict flow of liquid. 
 Made it through the night without leaking out! Thanks for all your help and encouragement! 
Now I just have to do the same thing with the next rewick.  
 Aged is another word for steeping. Means it's sat around for x amount of time.  Some flavors can benefit from this. A lot actually. It gives time for the nicotine to blend and do it's nature wonders with the other flavors.  I find steeping 0mg nic does next to nothing though. Typically, fruit and candy flavors are good to go fresh. 
 With fruit flavors, after a couple of weeks I think someone sneaks in and pisses in my juice bottles. 
 Strange that this sort of thing is not heavily mentioned on any juice site that I have been to.  So would microwaving be a way to help steep?  
 Alot of them don't but some sites like https://b-xvapor.com/ have a recommended steep time listed on each juices page. 
 No no no! The best thing - time. Heat degrades the nicotine and can actually cause flavor loss on some juices.  If you absolutely must, just put it in a warm water bath for a bit.  Steeping can make a good juice better, but rarely if ever will it make a shitty juice good. 
 No do not do that! Just leave it sit in a dark area (inside a cupboard or closet). 
 Just to add to the first post, dessert and tobacco flavours can often take 2 weeks+ to steep.
The reason juices need to steep is so that various chemical reactions and bondings can take place, this is what helps flavours blend together and can be speeded up a little by gentle heating, shaking etc. 
 I don't understand why the juice companies don't steep their own juices.  Its like buying a bottle of scotch and aging it for 3 years yourself as opposed to buying an already aged bottle.   
 Because of selectable nicotine and VG/PG levels. There are plenty of companies that pre-steep but you'll usually only see two or three nicotine levels and one VG/PG mix, to keep it manageable. Say you have (10) flavors you want to offer and are doing (4) levels of nicotine (18/12/6/3) and (3) mixes (50/50, 70/30, Max VG). That's (120) bottles you have to have sitting around for three months just so you can guarantee you'll have (1) of every permutation. So think about what it'd be like if you want to actually build stock. 
 Yeah I get it, inventory management and all that.   
 i have sigelei models and they all have been reliable.  can't speak for snowwolf.  i use sigelei models with one 18650 battery that can push to 100 watts.  i have never pushed them over 100 watts and use uwell crown model 1.  i don't use temp control ever.  70bg/30pg/3mg works well.  i use the one battery model because it's more portable for on the go.   
 Thanks for the input! This reinforces how reliable I've heard Sigelei's are. Does your version have TC? 
 yah.  never really use it though.  i have the 150w tc and 100w tc i think. i use wattage mode around 70 watt with uwell crown.  works well enough. 
 The 213's do have TC 
 I'd go sig213 over snow wolf 200; newer tech and lots of temp control options on the 213, i prefer the size and weight of the 213, the glass panels/door on the sw200 can break (not too common but I've seen it), and the longevity of the sw200 is somewhat questionable (work in a shop, posting from work now ;)) ... have had to return/replace a few and had more customers than that complain that theirs died several months in. Sig213 is newish so it's a little harder to gauge since sw200 has been around longer though. 
The only thing that bothers me about the sig213 is the bottom door, i worry about latch doors starting not to hold after some time. Haven't seen that in 213 but was a problem on other mods (cuboid). 
 I second jdoe123... used Sigelei 100w original one and it was super reliable and resilient. Now have 213 and its amazing!  
 I heard TC on Sigelei might be unreliable. Not sure if it fixed so you might want to check it. 
 The Sig213 is a overpriced. It does not go to 213 watts and it does not have a functioning TC mode. The preheat function is nice of you're using insanely large coils but 99% of people don't  
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvZpkMSwLp8 
 The negative review of the Sigelei had some problems.  The reviewer is not near as technical as he pretends to be.  He looked at the board and declared that there was no data connection from the USB port to the controller because he could not see it with his eye.  Prior to about 1984 that would have been true but multi-layered circuit boards came out at around that time.  Multi-layered boards have tracks inside and they cannot be traced by just looking at them.  What is bizarre is that he did not seem to think that plugging the thing in and trying to update the firmware was a good test.  Another problem was that he pulsed the fire button repeatedly to make the cotton burn.  Nobody would ever do that but he never showed viewers if the cotton would burn if the button was pressed normally.  All we really know from that review is that the mod will provide 155 watts of power under some conditions.  That doesn't mean it won't get closer to 213 watts with a different load.  That review appears to be a toxic emission of a different kind. 
 You can find a lot of premades on fasttech. As for the goon, it's a solid pick for an rda. 
 Great, thanks! Any suggestions for which to try first? 
 Haven't actually bought any as I wrap my own, but I'd say for starters buy kanthal coils that are the right resistance for the build you want. What mod and wattage are you looking to run on? 
 I have the Smok Alien which goes up to 220W. I don't really have a wattage in mind, I run my Q2s (Best 55-65W) at 60W currently.  
 Oh well if that's the case, buy one of the variety packs and play around until you find a setup you like. I'd definitely consider learning to build your own as you go through that pack of premades though. 
 Solid advice, thank you so much! 
 Try wrapping a rubber band around the base of the tank a few times. That should give you enough grip to loosen it.  
 didn't work :( im scared ive ruined it, literally got it 4 days ago
EDIT: jk it totally worked. thank you :) 
 I'm thinking that maybe you're screwing the tank way too tight to the battery. This causes leaking issues. With a bit of force and friction it should come out but remember not to apply extreme force when screwing it back in, just enough to not have the liquid come out. This is a common mistake in new users, so don't worry about it, happened to me too. 
 will definitely remember that for next time, thanks! 
 Okay I got you. Get a tiny Allen wrench and put it through the air flow openings on the base. You might have to rough up your coil to get it out the other end. Then hold the Allen wrench in place firmly and twist THE Mod not the tank.  It'll come off. Then when it's off, put a very tiny amount of Vaseline on a q tip and put it on the threads of your 510 to prevent further bullfuckery 
 got it open with the rubber band trick but i'll remember this if it ever becomes complete shit. 
 It's eliquid for a pound, made by a company that has had multiple different company names, and addresses in the past few years. The head company appears to be THORNTON & ROSS LIMITED, and their nature of business is listed as follows:
20412 - Manufacture of cleaning and polishing preparations
21100 - Manufacture of basic pharmaceutical products
Not sure I wouldn't trust these juices personally, but it's your money, your vaping equipment and more importantly your lungs you'll be sucking it into. 
 It does make me question whether to use them, thanks for this information. 
 Not worth it tbf, i would pay a bit more for a enjoyable e liquid. I ordered a stack of different e liquids (more of the fruity ones), and they've all got a bit of a mean aftertaste. I would pay a few � more for some quality stuff from the following vendors;
VapeEmporium - a bit pricey but worth it
TotallyWicked - again a little bit on the pricey side
KnockOutVapes - Seems to be the cheapest, try the Red velvet cupcake. 
 Knockoutvapes sounds good! Love the look of the Mr Melon one too 
 Vapetopia are worth a try they have some amazing offers/competitions and auctions. Their juices have always been spot on too. 
 That drumsticks one they have sounds so fucking good! Im gonna waste so much of my wages on this shit. 
 I haven't tried it but people on their facebook group love it.  
 Try asking in a vape shop if they sell Loaded Glazed Donuts flavour (they used to do a Smores flavour too) - you get 120ml for �25 and it's gorgeous! Also, Pancake Man charge �19.99 for 60ml (with a load of goodies like a unicorn bottle, badge, sticker, key ring) - I know it's a big initial payment but works out good value in the end ?  - cica x 
 My friend pointed out that I should've said 'Pancake Man COSTS �19..99...' not '...CHARGES...' - he thought I was talking about a shop/vendor selling 60ml bottles of the Loaded liquid I mentioned first! (as far as I'm aware, Loaded 60ml bottles don't exist) Oops! Sorry if anybody else misunderstood - I'd probably taken a sleeping pill and they have a tendency to make me a little brain dead and/or cause me to babble. Only fair to warn y'all!! ???  Lol... 
 Sounds good! I normally use a store called flavour vapour locally to get my liquid..I'll be sure to ask them if they have anything like that in next time I'm there. Thanks! 
 You could check the [juicedb](http://juicedb.com). There's not a [whole lot](https://www.juicedb.com/business/3612/one-pound-eliquid-liquid) of information about them, but there is some. 
 The custard is OK. Not great but if you're expecting greatness for a single pound then you're an idiot. 
It's perfectly reasonable juice to tide you over if you're short on cash.  
 Nah I don't expect it to be premium, just as long as its something I can fill a tank with for a journey just for a nicotine fix that isn't gonna taste vile then it's good with me. 
 That comment came of a bit ruder than intended. As I said though, I find the custard perfectly reasonable for a pound. The blueberry on the other hand was shit (even for a single pound) so I wouldn't order massive quantities until you're sure you like it.  
 Nah it didn't sound too rude, your logic is how it should be I mean after all, it is only a pound. I might do a �5 or �10 order and just sample some of their liquids that sound nice. Ever tried any of their tobacco liquids? 
 I had their Heisenberg clone which was nice but VERY heavy on the menthol and the two I already mentioned. 
I also got something called Cloud No1 which iirc is a kind of fruity/absinthe/mint flavour. It is the worst thing I have ever tasted in my entire life, no hyperbole and I'm not just talking about eliquids. This stuff is absolutely vile. I'm not really a fan of tobacco eliquids anyway and haven't tried one of theirs.  
 I used to order from them a lot when I was really broke. They're not bad but certainly not the best. Their lemon sherbert was always my favourite.
Edit: The tobacco flavour was terrible. Would not recommend.  
 One whole english pound? I can't afford that.  [99p vapes is more my thing](https://www.99pvape.co.uk/) 
 Propylene glycol is often used as a sweetener.  The vapour is not that sweet so it sounds like you are also inhaling atomized liquid droplets.  Try turning the power down and see if there is less sweetness. 
 My coil is listed as min 30w to max 80w. So makes me wonder if normally users vape high VG liquids with a default iStick Pico (Melo 3) setup?  
 Unfortunately although we all want it I've never found anything that tastes perfectly like a ciggarette. I do find that ahlusion bluegrass burley is pretty good though, pick it up in a high strength like 18mg and vape it at between 20 - 30 watts to increase that sort of earthy ashyness
Here's a link if you're interested!
http://www.ahlusion.us/blue-grass-burley.html 
 Thanks a lot for the hint. The description of the liquid indeed sounds like what i'm looking for. Unfortunately I'm EU based and none of the ecig/eliquid shops here are selling it as far as I can see.
 
 I'm from the UK too! I had a bottle of it at some point I can't remember if it was a friend that sent it to me though. I've just looked through emails and can't seem to find any receipt though. 
 Thanks anyway! I'll have a bunch more new liquids coming in the next days; let's see if those are more to my liking ;-) 
And just to clarify; for me it doesn't really need to be a perfect match to a cigarette; the ones i tried so far are just all having such a overly sweet aftertaste.... 
 Yeah I feel you on that. A lot of these tobacco liquids seem to use a lot of vanilla in their flavourings which ends up giving us a overly sweet flavour as opposed to that sort of earthy taste. What ones did you order, if you don't mind me asking? 
 A couple of Millers Silverline and Goldline tobacco liquids (Dutch) + Square Drops Old School Tabac. Let's see if those are less sweet. The latter had some bad reviews because they were quite neutral and a little sour. But with some mixing it might be actually a good ingredient to make it less sweet ;-) 
 It's easier to up your nic level before dropping cash on an upgrade and finding you're feeling the same. 
 I'm looking for warmth and throat hit. If I'm at 3mg, how high would you recommend stepping up to? 
 How many ohms is the coil you are using? 
 I'd have to check when I get home. I bought them at the same shop I got my AIO.  
 I just looked it up and it's 0.6 ohms. 0mg-6mg is recommended for sub ohm vaping. It's only a recommendation though you can go higher if you want to.  
  
Personally I would try 6mg. When people generally ask what to do when vaping is cutting it is to up the nic level.  
  
I started vaping at 3mg and dropped the cigarettes straight away. Nic requirements vary drastically from person to person. I am a heavy vaper though. If I wanted to cut back I would up my nic level. At the moment I'm happy chugging away at 3mg.  
 I'll try 6mg. Thanks! 
 With the AIO it doesn't get any warmer if you step up the nic; it has a set wattage. But in regards to your nic level; try it at either 6 or 12. If that still doesn't satisfy you you could try upping your nic any further, but I guess you'd be much happier with an actual mod like the Kangertech ones or those from Aspire. 
The best thing you could actually do is to go to a B&M shop and ask them for advice. 
 10/4. Thanks 
 I agree, upping the nicotine is a great options without spending more money. You can get a great throat hit off of a 6mg. Although, using a 6mg with high VG can lack in throat hit, in my opinion. If that still doesn't cut it try a 60/40 PG/VG for that extra kick. 
 Thanks for the extra help. I really appreciate it
 Anytime! That's what I'm here for. 
 Depends on the brand you are looking for, but there are many under-appreciated fantastic vendors out there.  I'd highly recommend checking out https://juicedb.com, and independent review community, and spending some time just clicking through some of the top rated flavors or companies.  
 I'll have to toss in http://ThePlumeRoom.com. You can also order samples before you go big! 
 The sidebar on /r/electronic_cigarette has a good list of recommended vendors. I would peruse that and see what juice strikes your fancy.  
 It's also a question of where you're living so we can help you out with some decent recommendations? I guess you won'tbe pleased if I recommend you a shop based in the UK while you are in the US and vice versa. 
 I order Modus juice from VaporDna. Damn good price for damn good juice. 
 This is too complex a question to answer neatly. I?ll try, but be aware that what you?re doing is equivalent to a someone who?s never learned to ride a bicycle asking about how to best ride their new motorcycle. Mech mods require good knowledge of battery safety, Ohm?s Law, balancing power output with heat flux, etc.
Ok, that all out of the way, a lot more info is still required:
* What is the nicotine concentration is of your juice?
* What kind of RDA is it? Dual coil? Single coil? Brand name and model would be best.
* What juice did you order? Put everything you see on the label here. 
* What kind of mod is it? Do you know if it uses a hybrid connection or a 510-thread?
* How are you planning on measuring the resistance of your build?
* What battery are you using?
Assuming it?s a high-nic juice (20% VG probably means that), you?ll want to build for around 10-15 watts. That means somewhere around 1.0 to 1.8?. But the build can?t be too massive, or else the power will be too spread out.  
 Would have replied sooner but apparently the reply message wasn't showing up in my inbox. I just assumed no one replied. I have done a decent amount of reading regarding the subject but obviously I am still lacking in knowledge.
Nicotine: 3%
RDA: Mutation X V2
Mod: Ameraclone, Fuck You, as seen in link below.

Ohm reading: Friend has box mod but I will possibly use a multimeter. I have one around the house somewhere. It has been a while since I have used it.
Battery: IMR 18650 3.7v 2500mAh
I am not using the mech mod out of choice but out of convenience. I don't really want to drop a good amount of money on something if I can not find something I like. If smoking the lower VG % (20%, I would have went higher but it was the most on the site) would be easier in a box mod then I can use a friend's box to try it. I planned on buying my own device after finding something I liked anyhow.  
 What RDA and mech mod are you using? Also what nicotine level is the juice? This will help us out a lot. 
Honestly though, this juice really isn't meant to be dripped. It's meant for cartomizers, CE4/stardust clearomizers, and things of the sort. It's gonna be harsh.  
 You're on a regulated mod - it will refuse to fire if your build is too low.
You should be fine - I have the Cuboid and it's a good unit - I vaped a build that was just about half that and it worked fine. 
 Accidentally built a .05 instead of a .1 ohm build... Is it safe to try it?
https://www.reddit.com/r/electronic_cigarette/comments/3cxdfs/accidentally_built_a_05_instead_of_a_1_ohm_build/
..just in case you're being serious. 
 Yeah, I'm being serious - and that linked post is on an UNREGULATED mod - not the same thing at all. 
 Makes no difference in my opinion, vaping that low is risky regardless of protected/unprotected circuit. 
 Every one draws that line differently. 
 You will probably go through your vaping life with no ill effect and will enjoy doing what you do, but on the other end of the spectrum the misinformed do the same as you and get hurt.
I'd rather promote safe vaping within a person's limit (and their setups limit). But that's just me. 
 Thanks for clarifying. Will mess around a little with more peace of mind knowing that the cuboid is taking care of my mistakes! 
 You would probably benefit from reading about ohms law and such - good luck! 
 I know about ohm's law, just never did anything electrical in my experience. I recently switched to a 0.25 (10/9 I think) build and shit's way better. My 0.12 was indeed hot but the surface was too little, eventually burning the wick. Now with 0.25 I can crank up the wattage to 75 and get a warmer and denser cloud. Up next I'll probably go for a clapton, to try out the full potential of my box, but I think I'll stick with the one I have now : flavour is cool with 40W and when I want to cloud 75W do the trick (nothing super impressive but man coming from cigs it surely is astonishing!) 
 Awesome, just wasn't sure.
Good luck! 
 BUT: only for the time your cuboid is doing well. I will not imagine what will happen when the mod fails with this low build on it. 
The mod also doesn't care if your battery wraps are ok or not. Just to clarify. 
 I'm going to check the batteries myself anyway when I recharge them. For this low build, it's temporary I guess, next time I'll aim for 0.5 - 0.7 (and next time probably means in a month. I decided to fire it at 75W and my coils look kinda black. Dumb decisions are dumb, I'm sitting at 20W now) 
 You vaped at .05 ohms?! 
 Yeah, I don't remember the build - but yeah - I remember it because that's RIGHT on the limit of what my mod would support in TC mode. 
 When i first started, I thought I could use just any cotton. I grabbed the first package of cottonballs from cvs. It was bleached cotton. And it tasted like it. 
From what I have found, when they use chemicals in the processing of the cotton, you taste it. Its probably not the most scientific test, but its my general rule of thumb 
 Thanks for the reply!
Could you please recommend me something you would use in that case :D? 
 Look for a store called Muji, I think they operate in the UK too, they sell all organic cotton wares. Including a big bag of organic cotton pads for about �4.
Edit: [link](http://www.muji.eu/pages/online.asp?Sec=17&Sub=70&PID=7119)
 This. I bought it about 6 months ago and I've barely dented it.  
 Decided to throw out the coil and just use one from my other tank. Thanks for the help :D 
 Get some rayon, it is called cellucotton... this https://www.amazon.com/Graham-Cellucotton-Beauty-Coil-Feet/dp/B001BKY3B0 stuff. I use it and it works damn good. Prob find it in wallmart or a beauty store. I also have some Koh Gen Do cotton that is pretty cheap off of Amazon. Hell just hit up a vape shop and try to get a free sample of whatever latest and greatest wicking they are trying to push. 
 I live in the UK and just found 40 feet of this https://www.amazon.co.uk/SANEK-Cellucotton-Beauty-Coil-BT42251/dp/B001BKY3B0/ref=sr_1_1_a_it?ie=UTF8&qid=1479170904&sr=8-1&keywords=cellucotton
Is it the same stuff it seems much more expensive but looks the same, probably because of import costs I guess. Still cheaper than any of this glorified stuff though so I could definitely pick some up after payday if it'll do the trick!
Also on a side note how many times do I rewick a disposable coil, or do I use it until it breaks? 
 Suggest searching youtube for whatever coils you are using plus rebuilding... something like rebuilding innokin isub g coils should land you on a tutorial. I have no experience with those. 
 It's a simply built coil, already did it with cheap cotton but didn't want to risk vaping bleach or whatever else is in cheap cotton. 
Gonna make sure to order some of that cotton though! The advice is very much appreciated. 
 Or just boil the cotton balls you got in some distilled water and dry them out, that should work too. 
 Bleached cotton is not made with bleach it just means white.
Organic cotton is no different to vape than non-organic cotton.
The only difference between the bacon stuff and the tesco (or poundland) cotton is how the fibers are laid out, more carefully alligned and in one direction which gives a slight improvement on how they wick up the juice.
Unrolling a cotton ball is almost identical to the fanciest of specialist vape cotton.
The difference between cotton and rayon (for practical purposes) is that cotton expands when wet and rayon contracts.  Whichever is easier is down to personal preferences. 
 When I first started dripping I would only get the expensive japanese cotton.  But then one day I decided to take a shot and bought 'organic cotton balls' from my local drug store.  I read it carefully and was a little hesitant at the fact that it said it had been whitened with hydrogen peroxide.  But I tried it and it's been fine.  The biggest flaw I've had with it is that the consistency is a little bit trickier to nail down then the nice uniform sheets of more expensive cotton. 
 Japanese cotton is really cheap, even at vape shops and a bag of cotton bacon (when u get some loot) will last a damn long time. I still got same 7 dollar bag I bought like 9 months ago.  
 Can you manually update the firmware or reset it from within the Escribe software? 
 I build custom mods as a hobby. Dna 200 board is $57 plus shipping . If you are interested in having me fix it pm me and I'll help you out.  
 That atty is badass, what're the specs on it?  
 When I need some zen, I smoke something other than those nasty cigarettes I quit. 
 I like the way you think my friend 
 I typically zen out by slapping on my headphones, putting on some viking metal and building coils. It's like my ship in a bottle.  
 Awesome! I'm guessing you listen to some Amon Amarth. If you like the folk metal type stuff, check out Agalloch if you haven't already. 
 Yeah, Amon Amarth, Ensiferum, Eluviete, Enslaved, Bathory and the like. Streaming some Agalloch on your recommendation and it's right up my alley. Good call, sk�l! 
 Congrats /u/Scallawag for winning this week! You will be PM'd shortly. 
 When I need to zen out, I grab my vape, go outside and breathe easy.  
 I find my zen by driving alone on an empty stretch of road with some good music.  
 Hell yea, thanks guys.  
 IMO, the 2 best tanks out right now are the TFV8 and the Cleito 120. They will both cover all the bases you want covered EXCEPT the won't have to refill constantly. They are guzzlers in the kindest sense of the word. 
 How do they compare to the tfv4 in terms of guzzling juice? I've got RDAs that I can switch to for clouds and tricks. I'm mainly looking for something I can take to work on a full tank and not bother with refilling until I get home, I just need it to deliver nicotine quickly and thoroughly because my breaks are usually rushed. 
 I vape all day while driving to customers homes so my juice consumption is insane. My best friend uses his TFV8 like you would be using it and he fills as he is getting out of his car from his drive to work, then again before his drive home. So I guess it's really hard for me to say but it may work if you have 5-10 minute breaks a few times a day like he does. 
 I currently have the TFV8 and the Baby Beast. The TFV8 has clouds for days but the Baby Beast does have better flavor while still producing an impressive amount of cloud for its size. I had the original Cleito but unfortunately suffered from the vapor lock issues that so many have. I'm about to try the Uwell SE-1 which Uwell recently released very quietly and from what I've heard holds a lot of promise. The air flow of the Rafale and the top fill design of the Crown 2, with a few minor but positive tweaks in the design.  
 Between the tfv8 and baby beast, which is slower on juice consumption? I'm looking for an at work piece that I can fill before I leave and not bother with it until I get home.  
 Honestly I don't think either would fully fit that bill. The TFV8 chugs juice like a child with a juice box and despite the Baby Beast not chugging as fast, it's such a small tank (3 ml) that you still have to top it off fairly often. That being said, my Uwell SE-1 came in the mail today and let me say that so far, I like it better than both the TFV8 and the Baby Beast. It has tons of airflow, great smooth flavor, great aesthetics, the best drip tip on the market (in my opinion), very easy too fill, and it's a 5 ml capacity tank. Honestly I recommend it above anything on the market right now. I think as it's so new, you may only be able to get it on Uwell's website but it is also very inexpensive. They have a package deal right now (how I got mine) that is $25 for the SE-1, a pack of coils of your choice of resistance, and the Rafale X (which is a dropper). I have no interest in the dropper but for $25 the SE-1 and a pack of coils is an insane deal. I think the deal is only going on until the 16th or 18th though. But obviously, I HIGHLY recommend it. Sorry that was so long but I hope that helps.  
 Also sorry about your TFV4. That's pretty fucked up that they broke it and didn't offer to pay for a replacement or something. 
 Well, he's not a complete ass. He offered to pay for the glass, at least. He wouldn't hear anything about the damage to the other parts, though. So I guess he's 75-80% ass lol. 
 Well, I always say, don't get angry, get even. Lol 
 Hi if you have rda's I would recommend an rdta like the avacardo or limitless classic both are great and you have the customisability of the rda to get the right build right for you plus the tank below.  The tfv8 has bad reports on the quality of its coils the cleito I love however.  If you really want a huge tank take a look at [Mike vapes review of the ijoy rdta mod](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OSX1BHmzCBY) $40 dollars for a 200 watt mod with a built in 12.8 ml tank is a steal (if you use his coupon code). 
 I have a baby beast and love it..but I'm not so sure I don't like my Atlantis Evo over it.  I don't have a Clieto but am very impressed with the Atlantis Evo.  It doesn't eat as much juice and produces a very similar taste/vapor to me. 
 As far as tanks go the favorite lately has been the TFV8. 
 The joyetech AIO is what I always advise as a starter unit. Very simple device, charges via micro USB and can also be used whilst charging. Spitback tends to occur on the majority of devices, but is something that happens a lot less as you perfect your vaping technique. Short, sharp puffs on your vape will cause a build up of juice in and around the coil resulting in spitting from the device. Nice long steady draws results in less spitting from the device. Also make sure the air channel is open and not closed off. PM me if you would like any further advice and I will do my best to help you.  
 Do not buy any device where you cannot set the voltage, wattage, or temperature.  My first device was an iStick mini and Aspire K-1 tank with the 1.6 ohm coil.  For many months I happily vaped 12 mg/ml cigarette flavoured juice at 3.3 volts (about 6.8 watts).  Today I vape 20 mg/ml unflavoured liquid in a Vaporesso Target mini kit with Guardian tank set to 330 degrees F.  Both work fine to deliver satisfying puffs of nicotine. 
 I've just bought a target mini and absolutely love it ( asthetically and performance wise)  but only bought the mod as I have a toptank mini that I use.  Is the guardian tank any good?  and if you've ever used one,  how does it compare to the kanger tank? 
Edit: incidentally, I also upgraded  to my vaporesso from an istick mini too :D. 
Spelling and grammar edits too.  
 The Guardian tank is great once you learn how to get the top off.  It is advertised as child proof which really means any CHILD can open it which is PROOF you are getting old.  I do not have the Kanger but I do have the Cubis and it works fine too.  The main difference is that the Vaporesso's coil has a ceramic jacket which protects the cotton wicking.  As far as I know all of the Guardian atomizers have a coil with the ceramic jacket. 
 It's how it initially heats up.  Let's say you wanna vape at 50W.  
Soft would start at 40W then move up to 50W.  
Normal is 50W.  
Hard is 60W then down to 50W 
 Thanks for posting that. I just re-read my manual and it didn't list what the settings translated to. 
 also, not to be a dick, just saying - just about every book/manual is available in digital form on manufacturer's website, or you can always email and ask for another copy to be sent to you  :)
(also, that power mode, is on a lot of Smok devices, and it's all the same thing (as arality pointed out) 
 I have one! The tank is meh, the major design flaw comes into play when you're refilling it. Because of the design, when you insert your coil into an already filled tank it floods the coil causing spit back when you fire it.
To avoid this, you sort of have to tilt the tank in order to insert the coil without pushing juice into it. On the other hand, the mod is great! Obviously since it uses an internal battery it won't last long if you're running super sub-ohm setups with high wattage. However, if you run it at 40-55 watts one full charge will give you about 2-3 hours of continuous vaping. Perfect for the days that I can't just sit down to continuously hit my vape.
It's my go to when I'm running errands or I'm going into work. Since you can just charge it at your desk I have never had a situation when the battery completely runs out on me. Since it's inexpensive I would say get it just for the mod, and if you have any rtas or rdas lying around use them instead.
Also, it's tiny and best of all you don't have to worry about carrying around extra batteries. 
 It seems like a good box mod from what i just read. Are there any other options that would deliver a similar performance(or even better) for the same price range? The guy that i was planing to buy it from has it for 72 dollars and he has many other vapes. (by the way i'm new to vaping so i don't know much)  
 That's a rip-off. If you can try to buy stuff online. Go and check them out at a physical store and then check prices online. As far as other reccomendations I wouldn't know where to start helping you there. 
 I have one of these.  Its a great beginer mod, but the tank it comes with is shit.  The mod combined with a nautalus tank is a fantastic set up for someone looking to start vaping.  
Be aware that if you are looking into sub ohm vaping the battery in the mod will not make it through the day 
 I'm pretty new to vaping (about 2 months) I run the cuboid mini. I used the stock tank for about 4 weeks. A buddy of mine got me into the RDAs and so I'm currently running the Avocado 24 and I love my set up. Battery life isn't great but I sit a desk all day so I can plug it up if I need to. I do really like how portable it is. I can carry it in my front pocket without being too bulky.  
 The first day or two, I felt like I could breathe well. I also usually have sinus issues, especially in the morning and when the weather changes it gets worse. I never thought to attribute it to smoking but I have yet to wake up unable to breathe out of my nose since I quit smoking. 
 First off, congrats on quitting! Second, what nicotine content did you start off with? 
 I started with 12. I'm down to 6 now hoping to be down to 3 by the end of the year. 
 Within the first two days my sense of smell and taste began to come back to what it's supposed to be (so cigarette smoke actually smells as bad as everyone who isn't a smoker always complains about). 
I also had to go through some sort of withdrawal from all those nasty chemicals that are in tobacco. Took me two days of not getting enough sleep and if I did I dreamt weird. Didn't see that coming though, since I've kept on vaping nicotine. 
Within the first week my lung capacity was bigger and I felt more energized than I had been for a long time. (I felt like a Duracell bunny tbh ?)
Vaping for me means freedom from the stinkies, knowing that, even though I smoked for 16 years, I won't fill my lungs with cancerous tar (plus god knows what else, there are thousands upon thousands of bad things in tobacco; pick one) anymore, and that there is a world of flavors out there to be vaped and discovered! 
Congrats on quitting smoking! 
 > I won't fill my lungs with cancerous tar (plus god knows what else, there are thousands upon thousands of bad things in tobacco; pick one) anymore, and that there is a world of flavors out there to be vaped and discovered! 
Not started to vape yet, but I am thinking about it... however, how do you know that the flavor is not worse cancerous? 
 You should do some googling about that, there are a lot of research papers out there about just that subject. Otherwise, to my knowledge (and I read a lot about this too), the flavors used in eliquid are food grade aromas (sort of the same stuff that's found in food) and more or less harmless. Off the top of my head there are a bunch of things some manufacturers use that are frowned upon (dyacetyl for instance), but again: do some research about this yourself. 
 As a friend got me hooked with the idea of vaping and he managed it to get of from cigarettes, what I plan to do as well... I did my research since 4 days in a row.
Here is my conclusion so far. The media is definitely as my friend suggestes lying, as same as big pharma should not be trusted in every case. I don't talk about the tobacco lobby that might influence articles as well...
Now I see the benefits of vaping compared to smoking but there are tons of questions that are not answered yet, and the one I mentioned is one of them. Despite of what you said, I could not find a single study that suggest that there is no danger from the flavors. 
> the flavors used in eliquid are food grade aromas (sort of the same stuff that's found in food) and more or less harmless.
Food intake and inhaling something are two very different things. As same as there are substances that you can eat, but if you would inject certain substances with a needle your blood stream, it could kill you. So, what you said doesn't prove that it's harmless to inhale. And here is the point, what different substances do to your body when heated and inhaled is absolutely not clear yet, it's russian roulette.
Doing research is not agreeing with everything you read. Doing research means trying to get information's and thinking about the open questions. It's easy to make a decision about one or the other fact, it's less easy if there are no facts at all.
Again, I am already interested in vaping, but I am concerned about a lot of questions that couldn't be answered despite of my research.
 Thank you! I'm very excited, my vape will be in the mail tomorrow I can't wait for my senses to be back to normal again! 
 I ran while smoking. I took my twelve minute mile down to nine minutes within a few weeks.  
 Boy where do I begin. First thing was a clearing of my sinuses and the ability to breath clearly was first. Next came by taste multiplied by 100. I was already going to the gym before I quit, now I'm also running 3 miles a day and not gasping for air. 
Each day that goes by I feel great for finally making it. I know I've given myself a much improved chance at living longer. There is no price tag for such a feeling. I smoked for 24 years and have not smoked in 37 days thanks to vaping. I wish you nothing but the best success should you quit for good, it is so damn worth it. 
 Off the smokes and on the vape for about 3 months now. Biggest change I noticed was more energy. One very strange thing I noticed was an INTENSE craving for greasy, salty, carby foods but that went away when I switched to organic ejuice with no added sucralose.   
 Where could I find such ejuice? 
 I purchase mine from a local guy that runs a shop downtown and concocts his own. #buylocal
[Here's](http://cloudchemist.ca/) the link to his online shop. Not sure where all he ships to... but check his 100% VG collection. French Toast Dreams is my personal favourite. And INEXPENSIVE!!! $25.00 for 60mL 
 Reversed my sleep apnea.  I havent coughed in a long lime. More energy.  
 Cleared sinuses and I don't cough as much. I kinda feel like I have more energy but I don't really sleep that much to begin with. Best thing is not having dreams where all my teeth fall out, although this could be due to a lowered stress level which coincided with when I stopped smoking.  
 I can smell my Cologne still when I get home from work.
 
 Related but other side of the coin... I quit smoking a year ago. This past weekend, ended up smoking for whatever reason.  Found my sinuses clogged, pimples on my face, a sore throat, and a weird canker sore type thing in my mouth (not herpes~ had a full and intensive physical recently for a work visa!).   Now that I'm a day off the stinkiest again, everything is going away.  Perhaps it was all a coincidence, or I was fighting off a cold at the same time, but I feel much better, even after only a few days of smoking again. 
 I stopped smelling like an ash tray, it might seem small but I felt a lot better because of that. Suddenly I was getting more work done as I wasn't going outside to smoke, I have more energy as well.
One point to note is that you do need to exercise, smoking does a lot of damage and just stopping didn't do much for me (still out of breath going up stairs etc), once I started running and playing sports once again I felt brilliant.
Not so much physical but I made a lot of friends that I would never have met previously, I've just moved from one city to another and you can go in a vape shop and everyone's happy to chat straight away, smoking was social but vaping is even better! 
 I used to smoke 3 hookahs a day, a bit excessive but not out of the norm here in the Middle East.
Within a week I stopped waking up in the middle of the night out of breath.
I love on the 3rd floor of an apartment building and at one point I was always out of breath going up and down the stairs. That slowly stopped within a few weeks.
Thank god for vaping. Saved my life. 
 The first two days was a huge change for me personally. (45 year old female, smoker since I was 15, Vaping on and off for 10 years now. Usually spend a year vaping followed by 1-5 months of smoking but have quit smoking for good this year and exclusively vaping).
That being said, the first day was the hardest for me. The withdrawal from the Chemicals found in cigarettes directly linked to an MAOI inhibitor was difficult. I suffer from PTSD and Anxiety, so having that gone from my system caused me to get angry pretty easily. This slowly went away over a 2 week period, but I still have an issue with my anger from time to time and during very stressful periods, I WIG the fuck out and chain vape like mad.
Second day my lungs didn't feel heavy anymore. I could breath easier, I slept easier. I also suffer from GERDS (Which is an excessive amount of stomach acids that causes extreme acid reflux. Smoking exacerbates this, as does Fried Foods, Greasy Foods, Acidic Foods, ect. My diet I can control, my smoking was a struggle.) Less late night chugs of milk and blowing the stomach acid from my nose at 1am.
The third day there was a lot of dryness and coughing. My lips were dry, my mouth. I needed to hydrate more, the vape was drying me out. The coughing was a dry cough but produced some mucus. Lots of mucus in my throat on day 3. Also noticed my tastebuds seemed to go mute as well, barely able to taste even spicy foods. 
After the 3rd day I seemed to get over the hump of the Chemical Addiction from Smoking, my body began to repair itself. At first I got a HUGE amount of Acne. (I'm 45, this was embarrassing). My hair got really greasy after just 2 days. But I had more energy. I also found myself feeling lost quite a bit. I never smoked in the house and was a 2 pack a day smoker, so every 10-15 minutes I headed outside. Now I don't do that, so I started going outside once an hour and vaping instead to disassociate that behavior with smoking and reassociate it with Vaping.
Over the months I dealt with my body flushing out the cigarette chemicals and the loss of the MAOI inhibitors found in Cigarettes became a challenge during my monthly Lady visits. There was also these new found Taste Buds. Foods I hated before now were fucking delicious. That was a huge thing for me as I'm a picky eater with my GERDS issue and all. Otherwise, I was good except for the occasional Zombie Tongue. I alleviated that by switching my juice often, sometimes vaping only a simple mixture of VG and Nicotine in which I made myself. (Used to DIY for years, then got lazy).
I think the biggest change has come with the obsession over Vaping becoming more of a hobby really. Watching the forums online to see something new come out, discussing it with folks, making purchases online I obviously don't need. Otherwise, I feel like a million bucks! 
 First of congrats! And thank you, I'm excited so far day 3 no cigarettes for me! 
 You're very welcome. Keep Going! You can do it! Day 3 and everyday afterwards is a cake walk. You got this! 
 It took about a month to start feeling better..I was coughing up brown chunks for a couple months after I quit smoking and my wheezing slowly stopped,I don't stink anymore,my clothes smell good,my teeth are whiter,more energy,not trapped by cigs anymore
Oh and I don't get sick anymore.. I get the occasional stuffy nose but no colds at all. 
 best thing i experienced was not coughing up flem in the morning. that is what sold me. smoked 1.5 packs per day and would spend an extra 5 minutes in shower clearing my throat. Fuck i don't miss that 
 Stairs.  I used to HATE stairs.  Now I don't mind making a few trips with the groceries.  Increased lung capacity, better circulation, ability to take DEEP breaths when the Dr says to etc.  Sense of smell and taste.  Some people stink and I never knew it, some things smell better/worse.  Is a good idea to get your car interior detailed to get the ashtray out.  Taste.  For me it didn't improve so much as change.  For example I always preferred heavy dark stout beers.  Since I quit smoking I find I really like trying different IPAs when before they all tasted like watered down gin and I hated them.
Related to last part I also felt an incredible urge to buy a fedora and grow a neckbeard (joking!)
Edit: Taste  
 I would look into something like a nautilus mini for a tank. Honestly, whatever mod you get isn't going to matter too much. Something like an istick 30 watt will do well. It's small, gives a cigarette style draw with the nautilus mini, and isn't much of a complicated thing.  
 Try the smok Pen 22 Its �20 from a very trusted vendor https://vapourdepot.com/product/hardware/kits/smok-vape-pen-22/
Also dont forget to get the juice and spare coils from the same place (their house juice is good quality and inexpensive)
edit - looks like a vendor post it isnt. 
 I trust you Paul salesman haha
Seriously though, it looks like a rad little tube kit for a good price.  
 Thanks!
Wowee 50 quid for the both! I know that's not actually too bad though. 
I know these things with all the changeable bits are far more customisable and versatile, but I quite like the look of the 'pens'. I'm pretty good with tech and also with devices so complexity isn't an issue, but the big battery bit with the mods seem maybe cumbersome - quite big to have in your pocket. 
I've seen the [Joytech eGo AIO](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Joyetech-Black-eGo-AIO-E-Cigarette/dp/B01CVQOM22?th=1) and it has decent reviews for a great price. Do you reckon that's a decent thing? I'd be willing to spend a bit more than �20 though for a better vaper. 
 Where are you searching where they are both �50? They should be way cheaper than that, even over across the pond. 
The ego AIO is a great device, just battery life is a little bit lacking. Still a very solid device. Would totally recommend it too.  
 Aha, I meant �50 for both together - just on Amazon. 
I might try out the little pen, and then if I get into it expand into more adventurous territory. 
Also, just to move a little way away from the subject, does a lower (eg 0.5 ohm) coil use more or less battery than a higher (eg 1.5 ohm) coil? Thanks again 
 It will use more battery than the higher resistance coil because it is drawing more amps.  
 I went from an ego pen style with  KangerTech mini Protank ll with the 1.8 coils, to an eleaf istick Basic, and I absolutely Love it!  So much I have 3...one for each juice company I buy from.  It's an all in one, 2300 mAh, comes with a GS Air ll tank with adjustable airflow.  Coils are under $6 for 5 at www.efun.top, good battery life.  The only downfall is the tank is only 2 ml, but I'm ok with that... I use the .75 as well as the 1.2 coils.  I have other mods, but always go back to these! 
 Awesome, I'll check them out! They look nice. 
 Aspire evo 75w 
 My main device is an iStick 30 with an Aspire K1 tank and it has served me well.  It has variable wattage and works well but I have a new mod with temperature control and it is a tiny bit better.  Today I would buy a mod with temperature control and the ability to use stainless steel coils and a tank that offered that type of coils.  With temperature control you set it up once and lock the settings and then just charge, fill, and vape, repeating as necessary.  Good luck. 
 No need for a expensive building kit. 
I use:
Micro screwdriver kit to wrap
Tweezers a pair of ceramic and regular metal ones. 
For trimming. I have a a pair of flush cutters and nail clippers. 
Ohms law is needed for mechanical mods. On regulated devices, it's not really important. 
I don't recommend using fancy wire for your first couple of builds. Building  simple 26 or 24g, will save you a lot of headache.  
 The tools are cheap from fasttech; you only need a coil jig, tweezers, wire snips, cotton and wire. A coil jug is worth it IMO, it's just easier to make perfect coils with it. It's also nice to be abvle to select a specific diameter as it makes a big difference. If I were you, I'd get some basic Kanthal wire to play with first, and save the fancy alien Clapton until you are competent and won't waste it.  
I have this exact kit (it's cheaper to buy the kit than it is to buy them individually)  
 I'm usually vaping three flavors at any time, vape two to three tanks on each flavor, just switch when the tank is nearly empty. 
 Ok. I'm just excited about experiencing the full flavor of something that is completely different than what I am using right now (Grape Ape). Thank you.  
 Back when I only had one tank I just poured the remaining juice back in the bottle and rinse the tank (never rinse the coil) and dried it with a kitchen towel. Usually flavors get vaped out after a few pulls, except for vaping coffee, menthol or anise flavors. Those flavors have the annoying ability to stay in coils no matter what. So if you vape those flavors you can just take out the coil and use it the next time you vape that flavor. 
Congrats on quitting smoking! ? 
 ?!!!! 
 you can change it out if you want to. honestly the coffee is going to overpower the grape most likely after a little while so it isn't super neccessary to change the coil every time you change the flavor. it takes some getting used to but you'll eventually figure out which flavors over power other ones and which flavors kinda go well with each other. 
as for cleaning, what I do for the AIO is just take a slightly damp paper towl and roll it to a point and clean away. after that I take a Q tip and dry everything out. if you want to clean it out before changing the flavor you can, but honestly there probably isn't enough of the liquid left to really need to unless there's still a bit left at the bottom. if there is then just taking a paper towl (not damp) and soaking up the rest of the juice should be more than okay.  
 Thanks ??!! 
 No problem haha  
 Once the wicking becomes saturated with a flavour it is hard to get out.  When I had a cold I was using menthol juice and after the cold cleared up I went back to cigarette flavoured.  There was a taste of menthol for a couple of weeks after that but I did not mind because I like the flavour.  If you have an ultrasonic cleaner you could try cleaning the atomizer in water or vodka and see if that removes the taste.  Make sure to dry the coil thoroughly or it could spit for a while. 
 get 3 new battery's for best performance.
Do not charge more than 1 battery devices with usb is a good rule of thumb even if they have balanced charging i still prefer to stay safe than blown up by an accidental float charge or over charge \
as long as all 3 read 4.2 your good to go with your 2 bay charger  
 You can get a third battery, but it must be exactly like the two you have and then just charge them in your charger. 
They don't have to be charged at the same time as long as you charge all three before putting them back into the mod. 
 you'll be wanting to pick up three new batteries honestly. you're going to want to keep them as even as possible, rotating them between each charge cycle so they all wear evenly. it's kinda like rotating your tires so you don't have some that are like brand new while others are completely bald. in this case, you don't want some batteries to be discharging faster than others as you could damage the battery. 
I would not recommend charging your mod through USB. it is mainly there for firmware updates. it can technically charge them, but it won't be ballanced. you will have your batteries charging unevenly if you use the USB charging and honestly that isn't a good thing as i've mentioned above. you can charge your batteries in the charger and then take them out and charge the third, but that is just going to take a lot of time. I would suggest picking up a quad bay battery charger.  
 What you can afford. You can get a cheap $30 pen kit. You can get decent $70 single battery mod. Or go all out and spend $100-$150 on a triple battery mod. Go do some research on prices first, then buy. 
 Alien kit is $64.99.  
 I'd say the max I'm willing to spend is 150.  Single battery sounds about right! 
 Also you can buy online for a bit cheaper. Keep that in mind.  
 Reuleaux RX2/3 or SMOK Alien will serve you well and work as they should... for tank grab Limitless Plus or Tsunami if you want a dripper.
That setup will give you what you want and that velocity style deck on attys will give you some good freedom to experiment if you want. 
 Hi Kazz,
It depends massively on what you want, if you're looking for something to replicate/replace a cigarette then a cheap vape pen with starter kit (includes tank, battery, charging lead, coil and a spare coil) will probably be best. I'm in the UK and that would cost no more than �30, given how we've decided to shoot ourselves with Brexit, that's about $35 dollars to us, probably a few more for you.
If you want something a bit fancier then it gets more expensive pretty quickly. My best advice is go and try things, you don't know what you'll like until you've tried a few. Once you've done this go away and look online to see if you're being ripped off, if so get it online, if you're not and it's close then go and make a purchase.
It pays to be friendly with your local vape shop, if it has a good community you can ask them anything you like and they'll help whenever they can, those few dollars extra can be worth it for that relationship when new to vaping but only if they're happy to help. 
 Thanks! what are some good online vape stores that  I can check prices on reliably?
 You can get a lot for $150, if you Google some sites you can find out the prices, they'll be similar online. I say this because you find big differences in store/online prices fairly often but it's not always that way.
Still sticking with go and try a few out at a store, see what you like, check the price isn't half online and make your purchase. People don't get ripped off as much these days so you should be alright. 
 Any brands I should gravitate towards or avoid? 
 I don't think I've got enough experience to advise you on this, you'll get a lot of personal opinions and from one country to another, available stock could vary a lot but...
In the UK Innokin are popular when it comes to vape pens, they just work and are super cheap to run, it might cost you $5-10 a week depending on how much you vape. Here's a link to a kit that works really well: https://www.myfreedomsmokes.com/starter-kits-all-in-one-devices/ego-style-starter-kits/endura-t18-starter-kit.html
(Disclaimer - I've never used the site but seen it referenced a few times and people seem to like it)
If you go for a sub-ohm style (more like a bong hit) then things do get more expensive and choice goes through the roof. As mentioned below the SMOK Alien kit is popular and seems to do pretty well, I'd avoid using any Innokin products if you want to sub-ohm, I've had a few and they've been awful.
Go and test some out, tell people here what you're thinking of buying, let them shoot it down or give it the thumbs up, can't go wrong :) 
 don't go chasing waterfalls, please stick to the lakes and the river's you're used to.
I would recommend you dip your toes in the water. Get only one mod/battery (or if you're getting the cheap ego 510's get two if they're cheap enough, so you always have one with a full charge upon deck).  and two or three tanks, so you can try a few different flavors and see what works best.
You don't want to drop a massive amount.. only to realize a few months later that you're just not really interested in it.  that would be my best advise 
 I'd suggest going with an evic two mini.  It's a great single 18650 battery that's really well built.   
 I went through vaporseller.com to pick up my Alien and batteries and MtBakerVapor because I'm an old school GWAR fan. Vaporseller shipped me the wrong color Alien but gave me an upgrade over the batteries I ordered and they were a little behind in the shipping due to supply issues with the Alien kit. MtBakerVapor was lightning fast with the delivery. I've also ordered (but not yet received delivery) from Vaporbeast.com. Their prices are pretty decent and have a pretty big selection. 
Edit: forgot to mention how much I spent...was as midge over $100 to get me up and running. Would have been less, but had to get the GWAR juice. Highly recommend the German Chocolate Beefcake (chocolate/caramel/coconut flavor) 
 Seriously. Go see a doctor. We aren't trained for this shit. We're here for did I burn my coil or I'm having this issue with my mod, what could be wrong? And not I'm having a health problem, what is wrong with me type questions. Go see a doctor and mention this and the fact that you vape. He/she will be able to do way way way more than we can.  
 [Ok](http://i.imgur.com/xp9sE9Z.jpg) 
 you only need to prime your coil when you put a new one in and depending on the tank its good to let it sit for at least 2- 5 minutes to ensure no dry fire or burning of the coil aswell as starting it off at the lower wattage before cranking it up .
You may just have vapours toungue and cant taste your flavour anymore due to using it to much we all get it from time to time. 
what i do is get a strong flavour on my pallet , eat somthing with mustard or black licorice etc or change flavours for a couple days and it will solve the problem.
Hope that helps 
Cheers 
 Are you staying hydrated? That's the first problem I had when I started vaping, and dehydration is a known cause for vaper's tongue/fatigue. Infact, its the cause of a lot of problems, you can begin to suffer headaches and everything if you're not drinking enough water while vaping!
Also, I would change flavors every now and then too, because if I vape the same flavor for an extended period of time, I begin to lose the taste for it, but it's not a big deal to me anymore.
Here's a link to some of the causes of Vapers tongue and hopefully it can help you out a little bit buddy. 
http://olympiavaporworks.com/vapers-tongue/ 
 Aside from telling you to GO SEE A DOCTOR about the breathing issue...
When was the last time you changed out the coil? It could just be an old coil. As coils go they produce less vapor and taste more funky and won't give you the same amount of flavor as you would with a new one.  
 Juice can change if left at room temperature for a few days.  Keep extra amounts refrigerated. 
 Congrats man! Welcome to the community. I'm a new vaper myself too.
First thing, get a charger when you can. Charging the batteries with SMOK Alien's isn't healty as a charger. There was a test by a redditor but I can't remember his name. Don't overcharge it or leave it overnight. And don't treat batteries like ragdolls. They are no joke. Carry your spare bateries in something protective.
I don't think you have to turn it off unless you're going to carry it in a place where it can fire accidentally. I only turn mine off when i put it in my bag or in my pocket.
Always spend time to prime your coils. Right priming will make them last when it comes to couple minutes vs couple days. Their lifespan changes between 1 to 3 weeks depending on how often you vape and the quality of the juice. When it starts to taste dull or burnt, it's time to change it.
Now, the most important part to me and I think nobody mention about is there's some etiquette when it comes to vaping. Depending on where you live, some countries are quite strict about non-smoking areas. Be carefull about that. Also, people might give you weird looks as vaping is still a taboo. You're going to be a cloud machine and most of the time, other people will run into your clouds or wind will carry your tasty juice vapor to the non-vaping peasants. I don't believe in second-hand vaping myself but still some people might go crazy over it, even if they smoke. They might also make weird statements. Don't mind them.
EDIT: Drink water. Vaping might be quite dehydrating. Also, if you are an ex-smoker or using liquids with nicotine consider getting a back up kit. Have fun!
SMOK test for the interested thanks to u/VapeyMcGyver https://www.reddit.com/r/electronic_cigarette/comments/5cdwkj/smok_alien_220w_usb_charge_testing_and_analysis/?ref=share&ref_source=link 
 How often should I prime my coils? 
 When you first install them, that's all. 
 Thanks a bunch for all the advice, appreciate all your help! 
 another trick i use with my baby beast to avoid leaking is to close the air flow before opening the top and filling as it may cause pressure to push the juice down the airhole on the atomizer
Great device you wont need another for a long time ! 
Cheers 
 Use a qtip to clean your 510 every once in a while  
 Wash and dry your drip tip often, some people don't think to, and I've seen some groaty tips. It's going in your mouth after all. 
 Whilst I'm not sure this post is in the 'spirit' of this sub, I will say I'm very happy I didn't pull the trigger on the 100ml on this and only went for the 30ml bottle, because it's bloody horrible. 
I've tried in a range of tanks / RDAs and it's horrible.
It worked ok with Loaded's Doughnut flavour to take some of the sweetness off though. 
 WHAT THE FUCK
 This is the opposite of ejuice porn.  This is 2 ejuices, 1 cup porn. 
 different 'strokes' for different folks.   
 I think your best bet is to get OSDIY Blue Ras Slush honestly, it's delicious  
 I went with OSDIY and liquid barns! 
 Good call 
 This is from the sidebar at r/DIY_ejuice, that sub literally has everything you would need to know, just have to search:
https://www.reddit.com/r/DIY_eJuice/comments/3lu9gx/nicotine_need_to_know_all_your_questions_answered/?st=1Z141Z3&sh=5e48cb5d 
 Not sure about the nicotine as I've never tried either of those.
But as for best candy vape, I think Fizzmustards Mustard Milk is my favorite  http://e-liquid-recipes.com/recipe/104221/Mustard%20Milk%20-%20Simple%20Strawberries%20and%20Cream
IMO it tastes like those strawberry and cream hard candies that look similar to peppermints. 
 This is a good question. I'm new to DIY myself, been using a nic sample from Nude Nicotine so far but been wondering about the difference between the 2 from Liquid Barn. And Mustard Milk is amazing  
 I'm a fan of Nude Nicotine myself.  I purchase the [Nude Armor V2](https://www.nudenicotine.com/product/nude-armor-v2-nicotine-base-extended-shelf-life/) and have always been more than happy with this product.  It is perfect for DIY use.  
You will see comments about their shipping time, and some of those complaints are valid, but the QUALITY of their nicotine has always been top notch for me.  
I have no personal experience with the Liquid Barn Nic, but have read some not to flattering comments about it.  
There are several good vendors and I have only used Carolina Extracts and Nude Nicotine.  I just prefer the Nude Armor V2 because of it's packaging.   
 From Liquid Barn you want the nic select.
The best on the market is Carolina Extracts, but it costs a little more, it's the best there is. I've used myfreedomsmokes before and it's fine. I have Liquid Barn now. Nude Nicotine is supposed to be pretty good, but shipping sucks
VapeClarity is another.
There are quite a few, you can find this on the sidebar of r/DIY_ejuice as well.
This sub is pretty dead most of the time 
 Yea ive noticed it's pretty dead! Nicselect I have is ok. It's kinda harsh. Which nicotine do u think is the least harsh? 
 Did you not read what I posted? Carolina Extract man is the best on the market. I've gotten nicotine from myfreedomsmokes that is fine with me too. But if you want the best it's Carolina Extracts no if ands or buts.

 Oh shit sorry I commented when I was smoking a joint hahah read right over it. I got banned from DIY for asking if OOO flavors were good. Didn't realize u couldn't ask for opinions on certain flavors I thought it was just that u couldn't ask where to buy flavors and such. It's kind of a bullshit thread if u ask me. They're better off just saying what IS allowed to be posted. 
 So it seems for the most part people don't care for OOO too much, however they do have some decent flavors. I doubt I would take any chances blindly ordering though.  
 Also when you posted the question the auto mod would have responded telling you where to post it 
 It's not that you can't ask opinions, they just want people to read and follow the rules and to search on their own first as just about anything you could want to know has already been made available and organized. The new mixer thread is where you go to ask anything beginner related. You'll definitely get answered there. 
 If you read the sidebar it tells where to ask stuff. They are a little tight about it, but there is so much good info. There is a new mixer thread you would use to ask that  
 You can always ask me though, if I don't know I can usually find out the answer 
 When you get unbanned there is this thread every week.

 You can find it in the sidebar if you miss when it was posted. You'll definitely get good answer there  
 My recipes on ELR are private somehow. I can't for the life of me find where to turn the private off 
 Do u know of a good blue raspberry flavor man? I heard TFAs was horrible  
 Also OSDIY has a good blue ras slushee flavor 
 Liquid Barn's
https://www.reddit.com/r/DIY_eJuice/comments/4jv1gk/i_now_understand_why_people_use_tfa_juicy_peach/?st=1Z141Z3&sh=5e48cb5d
But I think the best Blue Ras is likely a flavor base. 
 https://www.reddit.com/r/DIY_eJuice/comments/49mast/blue_raspberry_a_laidback_approach/?st=1Z141Z3&sh=5e48cb5d 
 This clone is supposed to be spot on Blue Ras
**Blue Voodoo**
* Juicy Peach (TFA) 10%
* Sweet Raspberry (TFA) 5%
* Sweetener (TFA) 5% 
 Also I thought you might like this recipe
https://www.reddit.com/r/DIY_eJuice/comments/3tepw5/need_an_easy_candy_recipe_have_a_blue_airhead/?st=1Z141Z3&sh=5e48cb5d 
 The Liquid Barn Blue Ras and OSDIY Blue Ras are atleast good enough to use as stand alone flavors. 
 How is the cuke mojito? I have m3, jungle no4 and earl grey now and they are all great. 
 It's a concoction of cucumber and battery acid flavor, imo. 
 Lol yea, its an odd flavour, but ita subtle and nice every once in a while. I dont mind it, i just cant vape it for too long. 
 My favourite is m3, but cuke mojito is a very interesting flavour. It feels like a chnage of pace from the rest. Not too strong a flavour, just right. 
Wont be my adv but its perfect when you want to vape a subtle flavour. 
Im bad with words..sorry. 
 Which are/is your favorite?? Interested in trying out this line! 
 M3, not very sweet, doesn't gunk up the coil. 
 It also has a subtle menthol finish to it. It's very refreshing and I hate menthol flavors. M3 is a great juice. 
 I'll absolutely check it out, thank you! I've also got a bit of a sweet tooth and enjoy fruit flavors; best desert and/or fruit flavor? 
 A lot of people like nuts and cream so i would suggest you try that, I'm not a fan of it. They also have tundra, which is mint ice cream, it was reviewed well around here. 
For sweetness you should try oasis vape, they were too sweet for me. But most people swear by them and they are really cheap too. 
 You're the bomb, I seriously appreciate it. Needed some new recommendations. 
 Oh and try jungle no4, it tastes real good, the only reason its not my ADV is coz its a lil on the sweeter side, but it tastes fine! 
 No worries! :) 
 All this for only 20 dollars . U get a free gorilla unicorn bottle . Selectvape.com omg the best flavor ever too strawberry milkshake from a diner  
 Any other juices you've tried it's comparable to?  Shows as $25.99 on their site. 
 There's a code and you will receive it for 20 dollars let me see if I can find it  
 Anyone have experience with these guys? 
 I never have before. I decided to give em a try though, so I made an order for the coo coo puff flavor and the frap flavor! 
Edit: changed coco to coo coo 
 Let us know how it is! 
 Ehhhhh. It's ehhhhh. Cheap juice is cheap.  
 This looks delicious! 
 I may be a bit biased, but it really is. And it was a lot of work to get the strawberries and rum to work together.  
 I don't have all the flavors now, but will after my next order for sure. Saving this post now! 
 They're all good flavors, so even if you don't like this mix, you won't be sorry.  
 That's what I want to hear. 
I've been wanting that Lime Tahity Coldpress for awhile now 
Thanks
Edit: meant Lime Distilled  
 No, Distilled. Not Cold-Pressed. They're different.  
 Cold pressed is another I'd like to get though 
 That's what I meant, got them mixed up 
 They're both good. I think that they're even better together than they would be separately most of the time, but cold-pressed just didn't fit in here.   
 Imma put this right here for you:  [http://www.quitthatgrit.com/egg-nog/](http://www.quitthatgrit.com/egg-nog/) 
 I like this. I am getting a note of carmelized sugar that I think doesn't quite belong (I think it is from the CC Circus), but this is a yummy candy recipe.  
EDIT! Look, this has been posted as a shake and vape, but it benefits a fuck ton from a 2 week steep. The off notes I was getting have disappeared. The sour is present and not muting the raspberry, and the sweetener sinks into the flavors in a way that makes this a legit candy vape. I am loving this. /u/mlNikon! 
 Interesting, I have not gotten that flavor. Maybe try bumping it down. Glad you think its yummy 
 Is razzleberry just a raspberry flavor or is it a blue razz? Also is sour wizard better than TFA sour in your opinion? Sorry I'm new to DIY 
 razzleberry is like a candy raspberry. fa sour wizard is better than tfa sour imo. It is more than just malic acid. I don't know everything that is in it though. 
 Fine. I will order FLV Guanabanana and Pink Guava, dammit. These keep popping up all over the place. Good to see you back on the regular, Runt! 
 How the hell do you... *YOU* not have FLV Pink Guava already!? WTF?! My world is upside down right now. 
But seriously, get it. It's delicious. And I saw Guanabana in /u/jdrocker77's cereal recipe, Shameless, which really intrigues me, so, yeah, you probably need that too.
It never ends, does it? O.o 
 I put it off when it originally started popping up because I felt that INW Grapefruit satisfied all of my grapefruit needs. Pink Guava has been described as a grapefruit flavor, so boom. Irrelevant.  
It wasn't until very recently that I started taking an interest in other people's recipes. I only really started taking this interest by becoming more of a member of the community and interacting with specific mixers such as yourself and yeah, /u/ID10-T. I spent nearly a year using the reddit DIY community almost exclusively as a source of information and inspiration for my own approach to developing recipes. It never occurred to me to take a different approach. Now, with some experience under my belt, I feel more comfortable with determining what recipes I want to buy specific concentrates for. Your world isn't upside down...you are just looking at an ass-backward individual.  
Now, with this new dimension added to my interest in this hobby, I am truly fucked. My flavor orders keep growing in size and I am starting to drown in 10ml bottles. There is no end in sight. None that I can see through the fog, anyway. But fuck it. This fog is delicious. 
 Also, as someone who has FLV Pink Guava, INW Grapefruit, and INW White Grapefruit, I can honestly say that FLV Pink Guava has something more than just pink grapefruit going on. 
There's something lychee going on there, too. It's worth having, for a frugivore such as yourself. :-) 
 Changed my flair on r/DIY_eJuice. And yep, I am definitely ordering this. 
 No *way* are you ass-backwards! You're just a goddamn pioneer! 
The only reason I didn't launch into DIY with my own recipes in mind is because I *knew* I wouldn't have enough experience to even begin figuring out what percentage went where.
Wait, let me re-phrase; I totally had my own recipes *in mind*, but I knew this wasn't like cooking, so I couldn't just smell stuff and automatically know what went well together. *That* I approach I absolutely *do* use in the kitchen. (to excellent effect, if I may be allowed to toot my own horn.)
When I started DIY, I was so humbled by the differences in flavor and intensity by flavor *and* brand that my first recipes *had to be* other peoples' recipes to start. 
The mistake I made, and **this** is *truly* ass-backwards, was that I ordered too many flavors out of the gate, so I was immediately too overwhelmed to make single-flavor test mixes to find out how each flavor actually worked.
Instead, I ordered a whole buncha' shit to make specific recipes that sounded good to me, then I got cute and bulked those orders out with concentrates that I thought would be fun to work with. (to get free shipping, of course!) So, really, I shot myself in the foot, and started at a complete disadvantage!
[B-b-b-but wait, it gets worse!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ADgCeYJMN4)
Then I caught the DIY bug, so *every. fucking. order.* was, like, 20 flavors that I need to make Some Things, plus enough extras to qualify for free shipping, so it didn't take long before I was so deep in the hole that I was like; LOL! *Fuck* your single-flavor testing, dude! And **that** shit's backasswards!
Basically, what I'm saying is, I really love everyone that is doing the single-flavor testing legwork out there. You're the real MVPs! And where taste is so subjective, I know that line of thinking is *so  unforgiveably* half-assed on my part.
We're all doing things using our own methods and our own timelines. Would I *like* to do single flavor testing on my nearly 300 concentrates at this point? Yes! Unequivocally. Will I? Probably not. And I would be a better mixer if I did. But I already feel like there are too many things to do in the alotted hours of the day to ever get done, even in a hundred lifetimes!
The truth is this; I would be a better writer, a better painter, a better cook, *and* a better mixer if I just followed the A+B=C guidelines, but, I'm excitable, irrational, passionate, flighty, and I lack discipline, and I know I'm going to die someday, probably much sooner than I want to, so, I'm out here, flailing around spastically, trying to meet the slavering demon that drives me, halfway, just so I can get at least one desire off the queue before another one overtakes me.
It's an exhausting way to live, but, really, I wouldn't have it any other way. 
 When my wife watches me cook, she says that I cook like a stoned person. My response is How do you think I learned how to cook?.  
I completely agree that those single-flavor testing review posters are the real MVPs. I feel that my approach has been incredibly half-assed as well, but you and /u/ID10-T won't just go ahead and let me have my self-deprecation, will you?!  
Fine, I will own this shit. [I am on that crazy train, I've been on it, and have been wearing roller blades this whole time.](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/12816#cactus_coitus_by_philosaphucker)  
I feel simply blessed to share this hobby in a community with such excellent writers and awesome people.  I love y'all.  
 Aw, man! I luff you tew!
But, seriously, don't be self-deprecating! Some people learn by numbers, some people learn by doing, some people learn visually, and some learn by their noses like dogs.
Most of my favorite creators are the untrained. People that just dive in and swim, making amazing leaps and grabbing for obscure islands along the way.
I love those technical artists that can sit with a single flavor at a specific percentage and detect every subtle layer of that flavor, and reference to perfection what other flavors can play nice with it, creating profiles heretofore unknown. 
But, I also love the madmen who are splashing and spluttering in the deep, the flora and fauna of uncharted lands gritted under their nails, and mixing with the briny deep that can whip up a mix Not Of This World.
Both are valid; sorry, I'm editing this, because I got a phone call! When it comes to mixing; I want madmen *and* scientists! The technical *and* the instinctual. Bring it *all* on! I'll mix urrythang! [I'm just waiting for the miracle](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Di-etRm4cN8). 
 You're not bassackwards, buddy. I've followed the same progression and am not far ahead of you on that same tasty timeline. 
Two months ago I made [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/DIY_eJuice/comments/4sivwv/how_many_different_flavors_do_you_have/d59sbvw) comment. And guess what? Right now I have 10 unused flavors sitting on my desk bearing witness to my hypocrisy. How did this happen? Because I keep getting excited about other people's recipes and ordering stuff for them but am also hard at work on my own. 
Do I finally mix up single-flavor tests of the FE Lemon and FW Blueberry I ordered to make /u/RuntDastardly's Lmn# and your... whatever you called that summer-inspired honeysuckle-blueberry thing? (Single-flavor testing is still something I insist on doing before mixing a concentrate in any recipe; I want to know what I'm tasting). Or versions 6.1 though 6.3 of the daiquiri/colada/vice, 9 bottles in all? Or a POG version? Or the next step in this GTKK juice I'm working on with someone else? Or some autumnal juice for this /r/mixersclub contest I'm determined to win? Is this what drowning feels like? Even if I take a day off of this annoying life thing that keeps getting in the way of my mixing and shake up all this stuff, there's only so much I can vape. I need an extra face hole in which to stuff all these yummy clouds.  
 This comforts me beyond words, because I know we're all on the same wildly-scrawled, tiny-print, too-many-things-to-fit-in-one-volume page. :-) 
 I haven't long been on this page. I used to have DISCIPLINE, or at least something resembling it, at least when it came to mixing (let's not discuss the many other areas of life in which I've never had any). But I'm here now and if this crazy train slowed down enough to let me jump, I'd probably just keep trying to enjoy the ride.  
 /me pumps the brakes *just enough* and waves her arm wildly.
Fuckit, man! Hop on! Let's all make more tasty shit purely by accident! This is a totally, 100%, viable approach right now. 
 I just got done shaking this and it is AMAZING. Well done, Runt! Thanks for this! FLV Pink Guava and I are going to become very good friends, for sure! 
 I hope you love the mix as much as it's smell! Like I said, it was a quick-mix I whipped up, trying to make something tasty.
But, yeah, that FLV Pink Guava will change your life fo' sho'. That's some tasty stuff!
I cannot *wait* to see what **you** make with it! <3 
 I am vaping it right now...sooo good! 
 Where can I get this? 
 Great photos.  Thanks for posting.   
 Audi?  
 Haha no, Australian model mazda 3 ;) 
 Hell yeah! I love the interior and the sequential  
 Great car, this one is a little different, we've done some work, she has 185kw(250hp) from the stock 138kw (185hp) 
 what e-juice is that? Contra something? 
 Contraband vape co(Australian premium vape juice) 
 Is this supposed to be a good deal? If so that's pretty laughable, I would NEVER pay that much for a 30ml of liquid, that's absolutely insane. 
 Never had citrus punch. How would you characterize it? 
 although, admittedly I haven't single flavor tested it, its more like a cheap generic sprite. 
 this looks great, thanks for sharing. 
 I made this up, subbing FW Fruity Flakes for FW Fruit Rings. And it's pretty damn tasty. Might just whip up a 60ml. Thanks! 
 I think I need to give Fruit Rings a fair trial. I just went back over my version history and saw that the last mix I used it in had TFA Malted Milk where the FW Hazelnut is now. I think I need to revisit Fruit Rings with the Hazelnut. And, thanks for the kind words! 
 I'm saving this for my first order after my first DIY order gets here. I can't wait for payday 
 im literally laughing out loud. Did the same thing two years ago and i still havent touched 70% of the juice. I retch at the thought of its cloud fouling my senses  
 You must have picked some garbage flavors. I've enjoyed 90% of the juices I've purchased from them.  
 idk, maybe im wrong 
 yeah i wasnt a fan of that line 
 Yeah I'm not sure who was a fan of it. I felt the same way 
 Looks good, will definitely mix it up here shortly. I have every thing but FA Red Touch soooo mix in TPA Strawberry at 3 or just drop the flavor altogether? 
 Cap sweet strawberry at two percentage would be my sub. Our jungle flavors strawberry at one percent 
 Cap Sweet Strawberry would make a better sub, for sure. 
 Try jungle flavors from ecx. Juicy strawberry is what CAP sweet should have been 
 Thanks, I will give it a shot. 
 Subbing TFA Strawberry should be just fine. 
 this looks delicious, thanks
 
 I have received some feedback that the recipe is a bit too rough around the edges initially and improves with a steep. This may be the case, but I like it enough right away that I have never experienced it after a week. Anyway, here is the [ATF link](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/9768#stacks_on_deck_by_philosaphucker). 
 95% of juice companies make a 0 nic. 
 To be more specific, I'd like to find something that is no nic, very low or even zero PG, without artificial flavors. Crazy, I know, just thought I'd ask around.  
 Crescent city Clouds 
 A friend recommended Apothecary Herbal Vapes. Looks like exactly what I'm after. I'm ordering some tomorrow. I'll post again with a brief review.  
 Best zero nic vape ever! This stuff is superb. The flavors I tried are tea like, earthy and sophisticated yet smooth and not overpowering. It's not froot loopish, this stuff is for grown ups. I'm a big fan. www.herbal-vapes.com 
 Which ones did you get, and how would you describe them? Looks interesting - especially the Dream Catcher and Wagon liquids- but I want to hear an opinion or two first.  
 I got The Wagon, Yuba  Gold and Spearmint on the first round. Then I ordered Dreamcatcher and Kinnikinnick. I'll probably work my way through the whole line eventually. It's hard to pick a favorite. They're different than anything else out there so it's hard to draw a comparison. This stuff is like fine tea in a world of soda pops. I'm amazed at how the wagon and yuba helped me deal with those pesky nicotine cravings and dreamcatcher really seemes to help this insomniac get some rest. Spearmint(fresh and minty) and kinnikinnick(rich and earthy) just taste great. This juice line may not be for everyone but it's a bullseye for me. Good customer service too, they gave me a coupon code for my second order. I recommend giving it a try but I wouldn't know which one to say you should try first, it's all pretty darn excellent so far. Let me know what you get. Cheers! 
 Yea, maybe next month for my birthday. Thanks for the info. Dream Catcher, Wagon, and Yuba Gold are probably all the options I'll try.  
 Right on. Let me know what you think. Have a happy birthday! 
 Great shake and vape, thank you for the recipe. 
 I'll try it tomorrow. I'm out of forest fruit, so I'll go with 0,1% blackberry FA instead and tell You what I think. 
 Cool, thanks! 
 Hrmphhh, I seem to be out of Citrus Punch and my provider is out as well. Anyway, I'll tell You when I actually do it, cuz I'm intrigued. 
 Let me know, i wanna see how the blackberry turns out. Think I'll order some next time... What brand do you recommend? I'm more into creamy and bakery flavors, haven't messed with much fruits 
 Hey, I'm back after longish wait (no Citrus Punch forced halt) - I made Your juice. On shake and some 18h steep - wow, I'm amazed. I thought Citrus punch is going to stand out, but no, it blended smoothly and it really helped to draw the pomegranate and blackberry to the front row. This stuff is amazingly smooth, with traces of sourness, but it feels more like sprinkles in the soda. Amazing! It's like some sort of soft drink.
I was quite bored on black pom pom, fuzzy dragon etc - this brings a new freshness to my fruit vapes. I'm going to leave some for a longer steep as well to see how it turns out after time, but really - thanks a lot for this one! And I'm going to buy some forest fruits to check out the original. 
 That's great. Guess i need to add blackberry to my shipping list! Glad you enjoy! 
 FlavorArt is really good, but also very, very powerful. When at 0,1% it's the best blackberry I've ever used, but above - it tastes like soap or cheap perfume. Usually I make 10% dilution in pure PG and then use 1% of this in the liquid. 
 
Dragonfruit (TPA) 5%
Passion Fruit (TPA) 5%
Strawberry (Ripe) (TPA) 4%
Here's a recipe I used to make.  You could sub one or both of the apples for the dragonfruit.   It would make it totally different but still good.   
I would suggest picking up some dragonfruit if you can.  Fruity juice is all I vape and dragonfruit is a main ingredient in my adv.    
 Which Strawberry and Passion fruit flavors do you have? 
 Both from Cupcake World.    
A UK flavour manufacturer 
 Sorry, can't help with those.  
 Stardust from Vape Wild. Watermelon, honeydew, grape and mango all cooled down with cucumber.

 that's not an infographic, that's thinly veiled spam
 
 All this guy does is spam. 
 Even if these flavors might taste different in a few days, many of my favorite cream flavors taste great right away, and I would certainly consider a shake and vape.  
 Either you don't mix much or don't know what you're talking about. Have you ever used TFA Bavarian Cream, FA Fresh Cream, TFA Sweet Cream? They all work in low percentages for shake and vapes and only get better with time but are still great off the bat if used right. As for custard, try 2-4% of CAP Vanilla Custard V1 and supplementary vanilla or cake flavors and it too will be good fresh off the mixing table and once again will improve over time.
Try things out first before you make an ignorant statement such as 
>if you have creams, custards, or bakery flavors, that's not a shake and vape
EDIT - recipe for example: 
* 4% TFA Juicy Peach
* 6% TFA Bavarian Cream
One of my all time favorite shake&vapes better known as Snake Venom Clone or something of the like. 
 Small percentages actually need more time to homogenize within a mixture. You can't argue with science 
 You're correct! However you cannot argue that they provide flavor right away as well. Those are the flavors we are messing with here. 
 Every recipe is shake and vape, taste is subjective so if you like it right away then go for it. 
 Wut?
So a recipe that includes cream, custard or bakery flavours and tastes good right after mixing can't be posted in the Shake and Vape sub?
I literally can't even. 
 I can guarantee you that it doesn't taste how it's supposed to taste. That's not a S&V 
 I have a cream-ish S&V recipe I'll be sharing shortly. It's fantastic right after mixing and just gets better but the flavor profile doesn't change.  
 If I make a recipe that includes those flavours and designed it to taste good as a shake and vape then that is how it's supposed to taste.  That is a shake and vape.
Please show me where the rules are on shake and vapes because it seems like I'm fucking lost right now. 
 The cobra is great but the tiger is perfect ! It's one of my top 3 favs, I am also looking forward to the new line I have 2 of your new samples now and I will be ordering some soon that zen is so tasty.

 I've had people hate on me mixing by drops before but I applaud you. I do it for all my juices, it works for me. I'll have to try this out it sounds interesting! 
 Yeah it's not the best method for consistency if you're sharing the recipe with others, but it works well enough most of the time. Let me know if you do try this mix! 
 Will do it, need to clean some bottles out and then I can mix it!

 You made me read it. First time I've ever read one of the cerealogy spam posts...I wish I hadn't! 
 Thank you I'll have to try this 
 Mega Man Yogurt (by VaporAlchemist)
https://www.reddit.com/r/DIY_eJuice/comments/4oe6k8/mega_man_yogurt_by_vaporalchemist/ 
 Replying to the wrong comment haha yeah that looks good but it certainly needs to steep with all that yogurt. This is /r/ShakeAndVape 
 His notes said it was great snv 
 From experience I can tell you that much cheesecake crust is going to make it taste like sweet crust until that 3 day time span hits. If you like eating just cheese cake crust I guess it could be an awesome shake n vape haha.  
 What would the ml amounts be for a 30ml batch with premixed pg/vg? 
 That sounds awesome! Thanks  
 I'm going to have to try this. Might have to add some strawberry though. Suggestions as to what I should use? I have ripe, Cap Sweet, FA red touch and Inawera Shisha strawberry. 
 CAP Sweet Strawberry for sure, the candy profile of it will be like adding strawberry sweetener to the mix. 
 Thanks so much! 
 The very (Reddit)famous Mustard Milk flavor by /u/fizzmustard is very similar to this. He uses TFA Strawberry instead of TFA Strawberry (Ripe). It won best recipe of 2014 on /r/DIY_eJuice. It's been my S&V for a long while now. 
https://www.reddit.com/r/DIY_eJuice/comments/33ns4t/mustard_milk_or_strawberries_and_cream_the/ 
 I've been over there way longer than this sub haha I'm well aware. I'd like to bring everything I've learned from that sub, ecr, and in general then apply it to Shake n Vape because not everyone has time to wait out 2-6 weeks for that perfect ADV and I can totally relate. 
 Well said, especially because I always go S&V over a complex recipe that needs time, and this sub could use more content. 
How would you describe the difference in the recipe is based on using the two varieties of SB? I know Ripe has a more candy-like flavor. I'm about to mix up 150ml of MMilk, and I have both types of SB in front of me. Wondering if I should try it with your recipe.  
 Use his, those recipes of the year have some serious chemistry behind them that makes it work. Some of these mixers literally compare the aroma molecules between flavors to arrive at a finished product. It wouldn't be the same, I would however suggest adding 2-4% ripe to give the flavor a strawberry boost if that's what you're looking for. 
 Great idea. I'll mix the SB & SB(R) at a 2:1 and see how that tastes. I love Mustard Milk, but sometimes I wish it had a bit of that strawberry syrup flavor, you know what I mean? 
 i really like the combination of 7% CAP sweet strawberry and 2% TFA strawberry ripe. Tastes like Strawberry Quik to me.   
 That'll get it done, or like someone else mentioned INW Shisha Strawberry I hear has very syrupy notes. 
  I don't comment that much but detailed information such as this is priceless. Thanks for the detailed input! I'd just like to add that I really enjoy VBIC @ 2% and raspberry @ 6%. I look forward to trying this at different levels.
edit: raspberry is (cap). 
 Try this:
* tfa vbic 2%
* tfa raspberry (sweet) 2%
* inw raspberry (malina) 0.5% 
 I guess that raspberry (malina) must have quite a punch. I'm interested to experience the individual flavor of malina and how is pairs with tfa and cap raspberry. I'm very excited, thanks for sharing! 
 If you like raspberry INW Malina (Raspberry Concentrate) is the queen of raspberries for me. It adds tartness/sour that you get from Blue-Raspberry styled candies. 
 Thanks, I just put it on my next order list. 
 TPA VBIC is a great, super-lazy milk for your cereal bases, too!
TPA Vanilla Bean Ice Cream 4%  
+  
FW Fruity Flakes 5%  
or  
FLV Cinnamon Crunch @ 3%
Granted, it lacks those subtle nuances of an elaborately built cereal recipe, but they're still nice S&Vs for when you need something fast, yummy & good-to-go. 
 My adv is almost identical...add 2% CAP marshmallow and 1% EM. Really good stuff. Trying to sub some Shisha strawberry in there for a bit more of the sweetened strawberry flavor. 
 What brand of marshmallow? TFA Marshmallow is TFA's EM solution. 
 Cap marshmallow, sorry. It's great as a shake and vape, really rich and full after a week. 
 Great mix. I've vaped a lot of this. Great notes. Thank you! Can you tell me why you choose tfa ripe over tfa strawberry for this? Do you think tfa vbic will change in profile if i mix 240ml of this and vape it for a week? 
 I don't have TFA strawberry haha. I started DIYing when Suicide Bunny's Mothers Milk was all the rage and everyone said Ripe was definitely the strawberry flavor in there and its the best strawberry anyhow yattayatta so while the only other strawberry I have to compare is CAP Sweet Strawberry it doesn't rlly compare as CAP's is more candy like while I get a more realistic and complex flavor from Ripe. 
 I hear that. So many great strawberries out now though. I got a sample of e cig express sweet strawberry that makes cap sweet strawberry sad. Flavorah puts out good strawberry flavors that are designed for short to no steep. I find, personally, fa strawberry to be my favorite go to. 
 FA Red Touch I've been meaning to pick up I assume that's the one you're referring too. INW Strawberry Shisha as well, I hear it does well as a jam flavor which I'd love for my ever increasing need for more Peanutbutter recipes. If only I could get a bread flavor combo down I'd be cooking. 
 Fa red touch (strawberry) yes. Fa red Sumner (watermelon) I haven't tried yet. Bread is hard. Toast is easier. Bread to me usually ends up tasting doughy as I find that baked flavor hard to nail down in vapor. 
 Either way im not sure where to start on it flavorwise. 
 I check this sub everyday hoping to find new recipes. I may have to pick up the vanilla bean ice cream in order to make it. But this sounds good! 
 I agree, VBIC is a great shake and vape flavor, and mixes really well with all kinds of fruits and 4% + an appropriate fruit % is almost always going to taste good. 
BUT:
ANY single fruit flavoring, you say?
TFA Honeydew. Great flavor otherwise, mixed 2% with VBIC 4%, tastes like poop.    
 Try 1% or add Pear. 
 I really wanted a honeydew-pear ice cream, which how I know that 2% Honeydew + 4% VBIC = poo; tried adding VBIC to a Honey Pearry clone-based juice, results were a disaster, did experiments after to try to figure out the problem. I doubt dropping it to 1% is going to help, though I'll give it a shot. When I tried 2%/4% and it was literal shit-flavor, my next step was to lower the VBIC and not the Honeydew, that might have been a mistake. Or maybe Honeydew is just not allowed to be combined with VBIC according to my tastebuds. It's worth noting that I have some kind of weird problem with TFA Honeydew that others don't have: 2% tastes like sweet, juicy honeydew melon to me, but 3% tastes like honeydew-scented shampoo. Plenty of people love honeydew all the way up to 5%, I'm just weird. Although, I have had some agreement from others on the Honeydew + VBIC = poop equation. Have you actually tried it?  
TFA Pear + VBIC however, as well as TFA Honeysuckle + VBIC, both fantastic.   
 No unfortunately honeydew doesn't agree with my palette however maybe it just needs to steep then? It sounds like a strong flavor. 
 It's indeed a strong flavor, but steeping doesn't help much. I only brought it up because I don't want someone else to have to suffer the same fate. I vape up all of my mixes, no matter how bad, and the 2/4 Honeydew/VBIC combo one has been the hardest to get though to date.   
 Damn well I suppose there had to be at least one flavor it didn't mix with. 
 There had to be, and leave it to me to point it out. 
Totally agree with everything else about this great post though. VBIC + Fruit is awesome.  
 Isn't this the same thing as Mustard Milk, lol... 
 It's not a recipe. It's a flavor break down. 
 [deleted] 
 You really, really, really, shouldn't microwave your juice, man. 
 [deleted] 
 For the above reason I stated, it just diminishes quicker and completely removes entire components of flavor. I don't believe there's any other reason/health concern but if you want to get into that go over to /r/electronic_cigarette because those discussions are pointless and widely opinion based for the time being. Especially when it comes to DIY. 
 Great info 
 Not to be that guy but microwaving juices kills off some of the volatiles which make the flavor which results in it going bad much quicker. Also you can use that 10% rule for about half or more of TFAs fruit flavors but there are recommended percentages that vary wild so don't use that as a rule of thumb. But you definitely have the shotgun approach down if your just trying new things but don't use that as a final measure of your idea of the flavorings.
Edit: By your wording it seems you don't have a scale for less than $30 on Amazon you can have one accurate to the 100th decimal which is fantastic for batches 7ml+ and will give you accurate recreations with every mix. 
 [deleted] 
 [most popular scale among us mixers](https://www.amazon.com/gp/aw/d/B005UGBG20/ref=mp_s_a_1_1?qid=1466011842&sr=8-1&pi=SX200_QL40&keywords=aws+lb-501) 
 Ol' Faithful right there, never lets me down 
 It's easier than eye balling believe it or not. Especially when you start premixing concentrates. And it's always exactly the same and much easier to tweak lol even measuring by ml can be a pain in small amounts. 
 Try Harvest Berry (CAP) 3%, Sweet Strawberry (CAP) 3%, Strawberry (Ripe) (TPA) 6%, Sweet Cream (tpa) 2%.
You can add a touch of bavarian cream or graham crust to taste. 
 Lemon lime by itself would be refreshing  
 Made this up earlier, it's a very nice shake and vape
http://e-liquid-recipes.com/recipe/698558/LL+Cool+R
 
 I made up a batch before, but was quite harsh. Maybe if I leave it breath for a couple of days and add some Koolada it'll be nicer? 
 You could go with strawberry (ripe) and vanilla custard v1 mix. I used to vape around 200ml of this until I got bored. Proportions vary from 5% both to 5% ripe/8% custard, depending what You like more. 
 That sounds really nice actually. I've run out of bottles but have some coming tomorrow, I'll definitely be making some of this up. This does sound like more of a steeper (4weeks?) though with the custard. 
 As for me and my throat, 10 days is enough and after 14 I didn't notice further changes in flavor (I also now make apricot/custard v2 mix and steep it for at least 10 days). I remember I used v1 only once or twice though (kinda hard to get around my place) and later on switched to v2 (but I don't suppose it can greatly influence steeping time). I wouldn't wait longer, as Ripe tends to fade away on the long run. 
 I just mixed up 50ml of Strawberry (Ripe) 10%, and Cheesecake (Graham Crust) 6%
I've read this is a really nice shake and vape, and even better with a bit of a steep. 15 mins until 2 hour breath time is done :)  
 With a few weeks steep it would be even better.  
 Hey there..i hv afew collection if interested 
 Try 2%sweet cream, 2% Bavarian cream, 2.5% sugar cookie, 3.5% cinnamon Danish. Maybe add 1-2% your choice of fruit for a little hint of flavor and added sweetness. 
 Howdy stranger! Was wondering if you were okay!  
Xbox 6mg, thanks for the giveaway! ;) 
 Lmao I'd give away cool stuff if I could. I've been so busy with life and my partners on here have been AFK due up life. Just wanted to show off my new mod and some of my juice :p 
 Hehe no worries, you give lots of cool shit already! 
 Matching a cigarette's taste is nearly impossible since much of the flavor comes from the actual burning of the tobacco. Most good tobacco flavors generally taste like the smell of burying your nose in loose tobacco, if that makes sense. 
That said, I'd recommend starting with the following list of highly rated tobacco flavors on JuiceDB and see if one of them perks his interest: 
https://www.juicedb.com/tag/tobacco 
 Thanks for the link 
 Few of my friends love the RY4 (ruyan 4) flavor. Might work for you. But I agree with u/CloudAlchemist, with the added fact that people's tastes are so different (what might love others may hate-which is why the ejuice industry is so diverse and lucrative) 
 [[classic light]] isn't the cheapest, but tastes just like a Marlboro light. Give it a shot 
 My favorite cigarette flavor is made by black note. When I vape it, I feel like I am smoking. It is a premium juice at $30 for 30 ML.  
 Looking for a Marlboro replacement you say?  [Mountain Oak Vapors](http://splash.mountainoakvapors.com/) Rangler & Full Virginia Flake.  I couldn't completely quit cigarettes until I found a replacement for after meals & beers. 
 Thanks for the tip! 
 Most of the cig flavours are poor imitations , it's probably hard to get the taste of a burning cigarette.
Why doesn't he try plain VG/PG, tastes good imo 
 Not only are these some nice, robust tobacco flavors out there on the market, there are also some juices like [Sweet Leaf](http://skylinevapor.com/sweet-leaf-by-liquid-state-vapors/) and [Honey Badger](http://skylinevapor.com/honey-badger-by-charlies-chalk-dust/) that combine tobacco flavors with other sweet flavors, which might be appealing to your friend. 
 Jon Wayne by Uncle Junks. Some costumers have looked for it because of its tobacco flavor. 
 Custom eliquids seem to be a doomed market, with Aug 8th fast approaching.  
 We also have a variety of premium E-Liquid brands.  We hope that with the correct support of the right bills, we would have the ability to continue to offer the products the way we do.   
 Absolute is one of the best shops in Colorado, love that place!!  Their liquid is top notch!! 
 Some people love olives. I hate olives. Then you have different set-ups, with different wattage, temp controls, wires, etc. 2 people can taste completely different things in juices.  I recommend looking @ juiceDB to get an overall idea of a flavor. disregard the very lowest and very best rating. 
 The olive theory? 
 That's a good idea, thank you. Middle of the road review make sense... Man, I wish I had the set up of those with super high reviews. Lol. 
 While the outcome could still be slightly different (testers= while not always, usually a bunch of cheapo tanks sitting out all day that aren't super paid attn to or maintained; not as we would, anyway. Not to mention most these days, being put out in zero nic only.. which also changes the flavor) Still.. the best chance to find out if you'd like a flavor or not is to go to a local shop & try 'em.  Imho gives you more of a general idea, rather than putting 100% into someone else's review/opinion.   That said (& this will prob get a bunch of flack) as someone who has no choice BUT to order online only & who has been super disappointed/frustrated after buying a TON over the past 5+ yrs.. Wasting WAY more $ than I care to.. just trying to find even a few I enjoy..  Imho, sorry.. it shouldn't be this tough OR different.  With nothing else do I have a problem tasting..  We all have flavors related between our taste buds/brain, so whether muted or super sensitive, I know what orange juice should taste like, to me... Even if it tastes different to you, if it's made to taste like replicated orange juice in some fashion to the maker, ta da.... should be a no-brainer & at the very least vapable. (ESP by this point)  Also, by now, regardless of device, setting, wire, steep time/method, time of day &/or cycle of the moon.. not only shouldn't it take checking a label, website AND then sitting there trying to hunt for & pick out any sense of flavor to figure out wtf it is I'm supposedly vaping. (try handing ANY juice to anyone & ask 'em what it is....  great entertainment, lemme tell ya!  Esp if you need a good giggle, phew.. Just watch when the powers of suggestion/influence & of knowing ahead of time are removed...  how even your fav all day'er.. gets turned into... ??  Hmm, mint-y? oh I know... bubble gum? no.. custard-ish... wait, cinnamon? .............   when its freakin' froot loops!!!! YUP, crazy, right?!)  Line up 10 different recipes or ? from different bakeries.. of Apple Pie.  Don't tell people what it is & have 'em taste it blindfolded.  Pretty sure anyone would, at the very least, be able to tell you its apple pie of some sort..  apples, sweet.. crust.. maybe cinnamon... but def. apple pie, right?  Never heard of anyone taking a pie back to a bakery saying someone complained it had no taste....  tasted like something else... was missing crust...  Or worse, =/  tasted like they could only imagine licking a perfume bottle to taste.  And yet.. ?  Sigh...  yah, it's really been a drag, trust!  Nearly every e-liquid, I'd still say could use a bump in something.. be it accuracy (most of all) flavor intensity &/or sweetness, in order to be more recognizable.  .....  now try a couple without knowing what it is you're grabbing/vaping.  The whole ??!?? huhhhh...   just got taken to a whole new level, unfortunately...   & I dont get why.  Because people use different setups/temps/ builds/coils... one would think it would be a LOT more universal.  I mean, hell... I could go buy ANY brand of, say.... grape soda...  from Crush to the most generic of generic & while one may not be the best, you'd still know it's grape soda AND....  be able to drink it!  Same with anything..  just not e-liquid.  At this point & as far as they've all come with e-liquids/flavor creations, etc..  I'd hope they'd be more universal, regardless. They say (idk if true.. I'd think it was the opposite, but? who knows) like 85% of vapers are using some type of tank with stock coils.  Shouldn't have to use a primarily PG liquid & a dripper with your own coils just to get any sense of flavor.  Even then, so many are still subtle/unrecognizable.   Overpowering, intense. psssh, bring it on.  At least I'd know what it is...   not perfumed, waxy, harsh, crappy, nasty.. peppered, lemon pledge furn polish, chemically, gross... who knows that I just wasted my $ on yet again.  The whole Catch-22 there is that I have to keep ordering more... just to find a few I actually 'can' vape.  ugh.   Girrrrrl, I feel ya, trust! ;) LOL    All over the place, sorry...  quite sure you get the point, tho.       ps:  If I enjoy olives....  I should be able to vape any brand of olive e-liquid & at least be able to recognize & vape it.   imho, of course. =p    Here's hoping you find (or have found) a few gems on your search! :)  Vape on! 
 In my experience its usually the vaping setup someone is using. A nautilus is going to have less flavor than a drip (usually), the crappier the rig/tank the less flavor. Also, some flavors taste horrible if the tank isn't clean for any reason, like a lazy shop. 
 Totally makes sense. Thank you 
 So many things can happen in between a juice being mixed and it being vaped by someone. It could be exposed to any number of conditions that make it taste different than intended. Not to mention the difference in vaping set ups, and how those will effect the flavor. Even if you only look at sub ohm tanks there's simply too much of a vareity to gauge a truly consistent experience for everything.  
 Just my own opinion but..  highly doubt there are many 'bad batches' being made/shipped.  At this point, should be quite the rare occasion, if at all.  Same goes for dud coils & leaky tanks tho, & yet some people continue to claim it happens & that, somehow, they keep getting 'em, so.... =p 
 wat 
 Wowza that's a lot of typing you did there. If you're interested in certain juices/vendors my best suggestion for you would be to look  up their ratings on juicedb.  
 wow nobodys going to read all that. make your own decisions dude. 
 Should have just listed the company names haha, Great Wall of text.  
 Yeah I wondered that half way through. It's a bit much. Sorry 
 Not sure about most of them since I'm fairly new to vaping myself but Giant Vapes has Cosmic Cloud half off and free shipping.  I ordered Thursday night and it's due tomorrow  
 You can also checkout our [flight boxes](http://hashtagvapemail.com/vapemail-flight-boxes/), they let you choose what goes in the flight of liquids, and you get a great volume discount [#vapemail](http://hashtagvapemail.com) 
 This is not the right place to post this.  I'd post in /r/DIY_eJuice they have a new mixers thread that you should post in if searching the subreddit for mountain dew  doesn't solve your problems.   
 Thanks! 
 No problem man,  I found a great recipe that mimics mountain dew code blue spot on.  If you're interested I can try and find it again.   
 hey thanks, but I think I finally found the mix I'lll be using :D 
 You probably want to get TFA Citrus Punch and TFA Champagne.
**TFA Citrus Punch** is pretty much Mountain Dew, you might want to start at 5% flavoring and work your way upwards, up to 15% from what I've read.
**TFA Champagne** at 1% will you give a slightly carbonated, fizzy effect to simulate a fresh opened sparkling can. 
 +1 citrus punch 
I haven't had a mountain dew in years but this recipe reminds me of it and taste great :)
http://tjek.nu/r/6dKd
Runch: %5 citrus punch, 3% fa forest fruit, 3% tfa pomegranate, and 1% sweet cream 
 thank you!
 
 I purchase most of my supplies from Vapemall.com, heartlandvapes.com, and nicotinelabs.com. All have excellent quality supplies and good customer service. Vape mall has amazing turn around on orders.  
 You'll probably have better luck asking in /r/DIY_eJuice  Also make sure to search mountain dew first, there might already be some threads on the subject there.
also the sidebar there has a ton of links to help you getting started making your own e juice and what all you'll need.
 
 Thank you so much! 
 Cereal e-juices for breakfast increase awesomeness throughout one's day.

 First off, thanks for the recipe. I've been looking for a use for my FA watermelon as something other than an accent piece. One can never have too many uses for Fuji as well. How would you describe FA Strawberry?  
Now more importantly, thanks for the story. It was a fun read. I especially enjoyed the bit about stepping back when struggling with something else. Given the name of your recipe, I don't really want to know more about how this girl inspired your creation but it is intriguing just the same.  
>an unshakeable suspicion that the part of you that was really ever alive has been dead for longer than anyone knows.  
I could vape on that line for a bit. Significance abounds.  
 You're welcome. I would describe FA Strawberry as a natural strawberry flavor. Definitely not a candy flavor like TFA Strawberry. It's difficult to describe. It's almost like the opposite of TFA Strawberry Ripe, which is by itself tastes like an over-ripe, mushy strawberry to me. However, you'd expect major tartness biting into an under-ripe strawberry, and it doesn't have that. It's just rather dry, not juicy at all. You could almost call it a dried strawberry, but that's not quite right either, because that would be super-sweet. Perhaps a dehydrated strawberry? Yes, that's it. **Freeze-dried strawberry.** I don't want to use the word weak to describe it, because it will make itself known at 1% in a mix with six times that amount of either of the TFA strawberries, but it is under-assertive. And that's mostly what I've been using it for - to give a more natural strawberry note to TFA and CAP Sweet strawberries and to tone down the over-ripeness of Strawberry Ripe and provide a top note it lacks. I don't think it's hefty enough to really get the work done as a main strawberry flavor. In this, it just blends with the watermelon and apple to make a nifty fruit punch. 
It's nowhere near my best work, I mostly shared it to pass on the story about what I do when I get mired in overthinking and adding too many flavors together, in case anyone else finds themselves sinking in that same quicksand.    
The juice named itself, Phucker: **STR**awberry **AP**pple Watermel**ON**. Yep, just another shitty portmanteau. Like I said, not my best work. I felt I needed to clarify: that lovely girl wrecked my heart, not my rectum.   
 Thanks for the detailed exegesis. You have described a strawberry that fills a void left in my arsenal. A void that appears between Cap Sweet strawberry and INW Shisha Strawberry. I'm going to have to pick this up.  
Thanks for the clarification on the naming as well. I feel a sense of closure and peace that my attempt at humor was noticed and effectual. 
 Just whipped this up with the addition of .2% INW cactus. You are right...simple and delicious.  
 Did you try it with the vodka, grapefruit, and existential dread? 
 Fresh out of vodka, so the grapefruit would add to the absurdity. As far as the existential dread goes, well...I would be hard-pressed to try anything without it. Might as well embrace it, I suppose. I revisited my Tahitian Lime mixture in an attempt to solve the steeping issues with the lime and we did not part ways amicably, I'm afraid.  
 I have in my recipe book that this: Fuji Apple (FA) -3%, Lime Tahity Cold Pressed (FA) -3%, Sweet Strawberry (CAP) -2%, Lemon Sicily (FA) -1%, Cactus (INW) - 0.5%
was a super tasty sort of apple punch, but I was getting a tad too much florality from the cactus. And then, after a steep, the lime seemed to have gone all Hulk Smash! on everything else. My plan was to make a  
Next attempt: FA Fuji 3%, Cold Pressed Lime 2%, CAP Sweet Strawberry 2%, Lemon Sicily 1%, INW Cactus 0.3%
Are you saying that's still going to be too bloody limey once it sits for a few days?
 
 I made a similar revision with 3% fuji, 2%lime tahity cold pressed, 2% sweet strawberry, 1% lemon sicily, 0.5% cactus, and 0.5% marshmallow (fa). If I remember right, the lime came through pretty hard after a few days on this as well.  
However, last night I did a complete rework and was trying to use FLV lime and INW lime to (0.5% each) to boost Lime tahity cold pressed (which I dropped to 1%). I also adjusted the Fuji to 2.5%, whilst adding Anton Apple at 1.5%. Cactus was at 0.3%. I made too many changes here and it just went horribly wrong somewhere. 
 Sounds like you made a terrible mess out of what was the start of a great recipe by trying to make too many adjustments at once. Who hasn't been there before, right? I'm just going try dropping the lime to 1% instead of the 2% I had previously planned the next time I revisit Tahitian Apple.   
 FA =  FlavorArt
TPA = The Perfumers/Flavor Apprentice  
 lol 
 Here you go?  May become a favorite for you:
*  TFA Strawberry 7%  
*  TFA Apricot 4%  
If you had some TFA Mango @ 1% and some TFA Koolada @ 0.5% to add it would be about perfect, but you can get the gist of the flavor with the two above.  
 
 try mixing apricot and ripe strawb, maybe with a tiny bit of apple and tiny bit of sour 
 The worst thing about bubblegum is that it's only good for a minute.  Vaping it is awesome and is definitely better than for just a minute. 
 Hey, I have a white Royal Hunter too! 
 I just bought a RH and I wanna know the build too! 
 YOU buy from a b&m or online? Where did you get it? 
 What kinds build you got in there? RH is my favorite addy  
 I had a single parallel with 24g or 26g Kanthol but since re-did it and put a dual parallel in which is reading 0.25 Ohms 
 Mix with a scale you savage 
 Just never invested into one yet. Maybe I would get one after school yet, money can be tight when you're a senior at college. I'd rather spend my money elsewhere. This works for me. 
 Trust me, it's the best 30$ you'll ever spend DYI'ing 
 Less clean up than by weight? Calling bullshit on that one 
 For someone that can't really afford a scale at the moment. I mean this works for me, so that's how I'm doing it. 
 What is with /r/ShakeandVape and all the papaya lately?  
 It's too good! 
 does the sour not taste like dirt to you? im scared to try this recipe 
 Nope, it tastes like nothing, and gives me a more sour vape. 
 this sounds like the perfect juice for wasting an afternoon on a pontoon boat
edit: spelling
 
 I don't have all of these ingredients, but I play with similar profiles very frequently. Looks good, man. For a really good time, I recommend adding TFA coconut extra at 0.2% :) 
 I'll have to get that at some point. Thanks for the recommendation! 
 I assume EM = Ethyl Maillol? Also how is the pineapple - never seemed to get pineapple to taste good. I'm gonna throw some of this together right now. 
 Ethyl Maltol yes. I was expecting it to be pretty harsh because of what I've heard about it but it's good in this recipe. I think the EM is helping to tone it down a bit. I haven't used it in anything else yet 
 It was pretty good, I didn't add the EM because I was out it. Also I'm not really sure if it does anything for me as far as taste. Much better than my last recipe that had pineapple in - I had 7% pineapple and it was not very good. 
 Yeah I've read that TFA Pineapple is only good up to 5-6% 
 I've enjoyed the pineapple/strawberry/Koolada combination in a couple of recipes recently and would like to try this one too, but I don't have papaya. Can you describe it to me and help me decide whether to grab some the next time I order new flavors? 
 It's strong. Very strong. I've only ever used it at 0.5 - 1%. And don't spill it. Ever. Papaya for days and days. But it's definitely a spot on papaya flavor 
 So, another of those weirdly strong flavors, like TFA Blackberry. Adding it to my list of things to order and saving this recipe. Thank you!  
 I haven't had TFA, but I have FA papaya and it is really strong as well. Wanna take one for the team and get both to compare for us? :p 
 **FA Papaya vs. TFA Papaya** 
FA - tried at 3% -  Delicious but very slightly flowery, tastes like it would be better at 2 to 2.5% percent, that might get rid of tiny bit of the floral perfumeness. Otherwise fairly accurate papaya flavor. Earthy, slightly musty. Really has that pulpy flesh quality to it. Possibly dry at higher concentration but not at this one. Sweet but not very sweet, with just tiny bit of an odd sort of spiciness on the very end of the exhale and in the aftertaste. It tastes like a cross between cantaloupe, mango, pineapple, and fig, just like a papaya does. Missing the creaminess of a perfectly ripened papaya. 
  
TFA - tried at 2% - Delicious, sweet, and very juicy. No dryness here. No flowers or perfume either, but I think it might get soapy at a higher concentration. It almost threatens to at 2% but not in an unpleasant way, just kinda says, I taste great now, but don't fuck with me, because I will take your ass to Bath & Body Works if you're not careful. Very similar to FA's with a few notable differences - one is that the slight hint of spice is not just on very end of the exhale, but throughout, and the end of the exhale is sweeter. And the biggest difference is that it tastes more like honeydew melon whereas FA's tastes like it's part cantaloupe (like a real papaya does). In fact, it tastes very similar to TFA Honeydew in particular, like TFA Honeydew plus mango and hints of pineapple, fig, and some kind of earthy tropical spiciness. 
*Does this qualify as taking one for the team? I don't feel like I've taken one, I just feel like I've got two fun new flavors to play with.*  
 Duuude! Excellent write up! I gotta go order TFA now to get some of that sweetness. Thanks a ton!  
*I'm just glad that you have benefited from doing this comparison for my lazy ass...* 
 Be careful with it. It tastes like it could easily take over a mix at less than 2% and I can't get the flavor out of my atomizer now.  
 Sure, why not?!
Flavors to Order:
1. Almost out of CAP Juicy Lemon
2. Almost out of TFA VBIC 
3. HS Mango  
4. CAP Juicy Peach (for peach pie) 
5. TFA Blueberry Extra (for Bourbon Berry Cheesecake) 
6. TFA Greek Yogurt (for Bourbon Berry Cheesecake)
7. FLV Cake Batter (for Red Velvet Cake Batter) 
8. TFA Red Velvet Cake (for Red Velvet Cake Batter)
9. FA Forest Fruit (for red fruit jelly for schneeflockentorte idea)
10. TFA Papaya (for Lost in the Tropics)
11. FA Papaya to compare for /u/Philosaphucker 
Unfortunately, I force myself to not purchase more than 10 flavors per month, so you're in for a wait, but it's on the list. 
   
 Damn...just missed it! 
 Just ordered TFA and FA Papaya from BVC on Friday. Starting % on the FA to try as standalone?  
 I tried it at 4% and it was pretty strong. You might be able to get away with 2-3%. 
 Thanks. I'll go with 3%. 4% is usually where I start with new FA flavors unless I've been warned not to, and you described it as really strong before, so I wanted double check before doing something I'll regret. It's a new thing I'm trying out, working to shed my usual precept, which has long been: *If no one arrives from the future to stop me from doing it, how bad of an idea could it really be?* 
 Thanks for the heads up 
 Hey there! I'm also in New Zealand... Do you have a Shosha (www.shosha.co.nz) shop nearby you? They have the Hollywood range... (I've got the Hollywood Cappuccino Latte 12mg in one of my tanks at the mo). Their website only shows the 0mg nicotine but if you go into the store they have the various nicotine strengths available.... If you emailed them they might be able to sort you out...
If you don't have a Shosha nearby you I could possibly grab a bottle on my next trip to the shop and send it to you. The cost is approx $15 I think...
 
 That Toblerone, though. Yo queres.

Been buying mostly premium juices locally in the Atlanta area since November/December. Slowed down a bit because i have so much, and want to find some affordable, yet quality, juices online. Coffees are some of my favorites so far but I'm pretty adventurous and like to switch around.
Questions or comments are welcomed. 
 This makes me feel inadequate.  
 The FRYD banana is ????????. So good  
 Have you tried that Raspberry from Northland Vapors? Bad reviews on JuiceDB so I don't think I'll ever consider it, but maybe the bad reviews tasted it before it steeped properly. 
 yeah, it's not my favorite. i mix it sometimes with others. just got jelly donut from bigbottleco and i find a little bit of the raspberry is good with that. a lot of the cheaper big bottles i've found online just don;t pack much of a punch, but bigbottleco has, so far, been great for the price. not as good as premium but better than, say, vistavapors or any other custom juice place with 100+ flavors. 
 Thanks for your opinion. I just got my Nuts and Cream. It's kind of bitter. I don't get the cream from it. Kind of bummed, but still vapable. Just didn't live up to the hype. Probably won't buy from Northland again. 
 I see you have a northland bottle, how is it? And also, from that savage bottle, where are you from? 
 Http://juicedb.com is one of the best resources to discover new eliquids online. Community reviews, various sorting and filtering options, even shows deals for company you're looking at.

 I go to b&ms to try juice and decide on what to order next based on if I like them or not. 
 Unfortunately, I live in a state where it's illegal to vape in the smoke shops - huge pain in the ass  
 The fuck? I'm sorry man, what state would this be?? 
 MA 
 Just saw this. I live in Boston where they raised the smoking age, si I can't go to B&M's anymore. I do suggest E-Cig Barn in Abington though. Been there a couple of times and their house juices aren't half bad. Just pick a profile that you like though when you go there. 
 I'm guessing it's a super sweet juice sweetened with Sucralose. Sucralose can gunk up coils like crazy, similar to sugar sticking to a pan. 
 I've used many a super sweet e-liquid, H/C included. I mean One Hit Wonder is a known 'coil gunker' & still...  never had 'em get that bad... that quickly. Sucks if your vape is tasting that ? ... & would cost a small fortune if you had to swap 'em out hourly.  That said, if you truly like the flavor, the first thought I had was to use only your dripper w/ that flavor.  Easy (and cheap) to swap out cotton if need be, ya know =)  Could your device have been set too high OR idk... wasn't primed/broken in well enough?  Just seems SO fast, that's all.  Hope you've found lots of good flavors that don't ruin your coils in an hour.... OR are happily dripping some Pink Bunny, now.  :) Enjoy! Live long(ER) & vape on! #ABillionLives 
 Reading the comments on Loopies makes me a bit sad. I loath lemon flavour. I've only had one Fruit Loops juice where the lemon wasn't trying to murder me. 
And it was so freaking good. 
Do you guys use alcohol or sweeteners? Ethyl maltol? 
 No sweeteners according to the FAQ      
https://northlandvapor.com/tools/help-center#!q-do-you-use-any-artificial-colorings-or-preservatives-in-your-eliquid 
 Thanks /u/coolloser - that is absolutely right! 
 I just put in an order for Nuts and Cream after Ooh La La sent me completely unusable juice. The hype is real, I cannot wait. I need an affordable ADV, sub-ohm tanks are murder on the wallet. 
 Ends Sunday at midnight! 
 Noooooooo, i just put an order in a half hour ago :( 
 In for about 6 bottles. Thanks for doing this... it's been an expensive month losing my mother :( I'm anxious to try your juice! Even MechSauce has been pricey for me these past few weeks. Happy Easter! 
 Their juice is good. I won a giveaway from them and had to order more. They threw in the nuts and cream for me and even though I'm not a nut fan, I'm glad they did. I can't put it down and ordered two more 120mls. (One more of the jungle no4 and raspberry creme brulee too hehe) 
 Good to hear, raspberry creme sounded good but I been burned on EVERY raspberry juice I have tried, way to scared to buy it lol. 
 Read their faq, I think it mentions the raspberry being one of the ones people either love or hate 
 Yeah, every site should have that with raspberry to be honest.
I love raspberries, it just doesn't usually translate well for me with vaping. 
 It certainly seems harder than strawberry to do right. [[60 fps]] was a winner for me on the raspberry front. 
 Awesome, thanks!
Can you edit the .5% to read 0.5%? 
 Good idea lol, thank you :) 
 Thanks for the edit!

 Was TFA Lemon chosen because it was the lemon you had, because it was best, or because it was necessary for the Shake and Vape?
Just wondering, I have TFA Lemon, but also a ton of other lemons I could experiment with.  Thanks man! Going to make as is in a bit. 
 It's the only lemon I have ATM, I would love to experiment with others lol 
 Ditto. I wonder how Lemon Sicily would be in this... 
 I used CAP Lemon Sicily at 8% in place of TFA Lemon, and FA Cookie in place of the Biscuit and I seriously think it's the best thing I've ever vape. Tastes just like those lemon girl scout cookies
 
 I feel like you robbed a B&M 
 That came to my mind too.... Those cases scream it 
 Lemme get that M.O.A.B. <3 
 Tried this one with all TFA Banana Cream and CAP Vanilla Custard (V1). I kept the TFA Banana Cream at 5% but decreased CAP Vanilla Custard to 6%, and it came out great. Simple and delicious, with no required steep, what's not to like?
Thanks for sharing! 
 No problem! I may have to try your variation later today :) 
 I've always found desert type flavours require a couple of weeks steeping time, did you immerse in hot water or anything? 
what ratio did you use (vg/pg/nic) 
I've got all these ingredients and quite tempted to make some 
actually I've got regular LA banana cream (the atomic yellow type), is there much difference between the two do you know?  
 I did give it a quick, 30 second hot water bath. I always mix at 70/30, at 1.5mg. It probably could benefit from a week or two of steeping, but I'm pretty damn impatient and can't be bothered with it lol. I don't think there's a difference between the yellow Banana Cream and the colorless one, but I could be wrong. 
 just nipped home specifically to knock up 20ml of this, didn't add any extra pg though and it has that nuclear coloured twang that only LA banana cream provides :)  
 You impregnated 20ml's of juice? ...damn man.
All jokes aside, I'm glad you enjoy it! 
 yeah i tapped your recipe up hard mate 
the little slut  
 cool will give this a blast mate nice one :)  
 tasting really nice after a quick dunk in some hot water and a vigorous shake 
reckon this would be the tits after a couple of weeks 
cheers for posting it up :)  
 caned my bottle in a day 
gonna try this later with blueberry wild & blueberry extra instead of the strawberry  
 Very Good I'd been looking for a good Banana,  Thanks
 
 Just ordered your blueberry donut and that mindful monkey. I'm excited to try it. Thanks for the great deal! Keep it up, us broke bastards need all the help we can get.  
 The blueberry is the most accurate I've ever tasted! Sadly I'm not a fan of real blueberry... But if I were, it'd be an ADV for sure. 
 Mindful Monkey is my new crack and my SO has gone through two tanks of The Tiger. We still have three more to try but if the smell and how the other two taste are any indication, they're gonna be awesome. Nice and smooth too! 
 We're glad that you and your SO like them! Thanks for your kind words we put months of work into each flavor. Please let your friends know about us :) 
 I will for sure! I'll put some reviews up once we've tried them all :)

 Mothers Milk is great,i bought some,my mouth feel good after vaping it.I also tried Captain America which is top blend,taste like mixed vanilla, orange, milk.I am not sure you will like it.So i wont post any link here. 
 Anything in the Think or Moustachery line.  Those flavors are bomb!  And I think i know a thing or two about juice flavors.  I review them on IG @ripreviews 
 TFA Cranberry has a marvelously unique flavor profile and works great with stone fruits and citrus.  Awesome work on this.  Don't have FA Apricot or Mad Fruit tho.  Yet. 
 thanks = ). this recipe can be messed with alot and still come out good. soon im going to try adding cherry crush for a cherry limeade possibly 
 Hey looks good! I don't have apricot or cranberry, but this Pomegranate/Mad fruit/Lime combo definitely sounds worth messing with.  
 the apricot and cranberry make this yummzy, i suggest getting those flavors 
 oh yeah...definitely going on the list for my next order. I placed an order for 16 more flavors this week and am already working on a new list...damn rabbit hole. lol 
 a rabbit hole indeed. but down there you might find some good things, like psychedelics hehe 
 One of my favorite activities is sinking down into my couch with my mod and pretending that I am a hookah smoking caterpillar. O^o^o^o^o 
 words can describe how cool that is, alas, i cannot find them 
 I mixed [tfa pear, tfa strawberry ripe and tfa kiwi double](https://www.reddit.com/r/DIY_eJuice/comments/3fswtx/laughing_at_my_newest_concoction/). Result: jalape�os and freshly cut grass. 
 Just google HIC's recipes and avoid those. 
 No joking here folks. The only one of HIC's that even came close to enjoyment for me was Lemon Meringue Pie and even that was lacking.  
 I used TFA Honey without reading up on it. I made a whole bar smell like hot piss. 
 i have a couple but i don't know them by heart and they are written on my phone, will post soon
 
 anything cherry  
 Think I'll try BB first, seems a good way to sweeten up my Monday 
 Add some koolada in there and you've got the float aspect 
 Most certainly. The harshness after steeping is definitely a problem here though. I'm going to be getting ahold of some other lime flavors soon and revisit this one. 
 Thanks to /u/Breazy_com for the giveaway on /r/ECR
This stuff is really good.  I'm not a huge fan of apple, but I LOVE apple fritter donuts and this is a pretty accurate interpretation.  One of the better pastry-centric juices I've encountered  
 Glad you are enjoying it and thanks for the tag! 
 I love all five o juices. Except that one. To me. Opinion by the way. Different to other people's opinions. Is That the after taste is that of cheap perfume.  
 I'm still here! I don't have all these flavours though so I can't try this recipe right now :(  
 I do something similar but without the blueberry :)   
 Same here! Slightly lower percentages but this looks promising.  I'm going mix this up this weekend!  
 Yup! Actually most of the time I couldn't tell you the actual percent... I just toss some strawberry and raspberry.... And whatever other fruit I'm craving lately in.   Some of this, some of that, and Bam.  I'm on my way!  
 Interesting! I think I'll try this tonight with inawera raspberry instead of the TFA!  
 Let us know how it is! I need to get my hands on INW raspberry. I hear it's far better than TFA's. 
 Its even great standalone at 4%, I love the stuff :-)  
 I am here. Please continue to post! I like seeing simple recipes like this. 
 Good to hear! I'm slowly easing into making my own recipes, although they are all usually really simple. Most of what I vape is other people's recipes and clones lol.  
 Gonna give this a try next time I mix up a batch of juice, thanks!
I've been really diggin' the blueberry lately for some reason--which is odd, because I'm not normally a blueberry fan.
Edit: made the berry one. Love it. :) 
 People participate here regularly, but just like a quick share, not a lot of discussion. I think it'd be great if it had more activity, but its useful as is too.

 My adv is very similar to this.  
 Made my first mixes today, and this was one of them. Very good! I could see this becoming an ADV. Thanks. 
 Awesome I'm mixing another batch today  
 Do you think the CAP sweet strawberry could be subbed with TFA strawberry ripe? 
 I feel like TFA/TPA strawberry ripe is more of a realistic fresh strawberries flavor, while CAP sweet strawberry is a little more candy-like. FA's Strawberry (red touch) is probably my favorite though. That could probably go in place of sweet strawberry.  
 Not sure of the Relitave percentages but I think you could do that. Strawberry ripe will make it more tart compared to sweet though.  
 Don't know, I have never purchased strawberry ripe yet  
 That's actually 20% if you mixed it at 6ml out of 30.  Assuming the flavoring is PG-based, that's a 80/20 VG/PG mix, which should be fine for flavor to come through...but I'm not at all familiar with this flavor either.
Next question would be what are you vaping it on and is this possibly a case of vaper's tongue?
This *might* be a question better asked over @ /r/DIY_eJuice , though I'm not 100% of their rules on posting... 
 A friend of mine (who got me into DIY) does a similar recipe, using MBV flavors. He also adds a small amount of Vanilla Custard (around 2%), and we use more BC (around 8).
That said, the combination of flavors is awesome, you're right about that. It's one of my favorite ADV's, and I've taken to combining the cream base with other fruits (to varying degrees of success - strawberry still needs work, but peach and raspberry were fantastic).
Edit - Also, especially for a shake n vape, I tried adding a very small percentage of TFA Dragonfruit last time I made it, and I thought that came out nice as well, without adulterating the blackberry too much.
And stay away from FA Blackberry - I still haven't figured that one out (though I want to). 
 Black currant is on my list of to-buy for sure.  I don't have it right now, but I think it'd be good to add just a little.
Also I REALLY need to buy some peach.  I've been seeing too many recipes with peach that sound amazing.  Now I'm thinking peach/ bavarian, which sounds amazing.  Huh!  I wonder if by some combination of yogurt and bavarian cream I can make a sweet cottage cheese flavor.  My childhood was filled with peaches and cottage cheese.  I'd love that. 
 Also! The peach I used was TFA Juicy Peach. Needed a little steep to really come together, but after a week or so, it's like some sort of alchemy - I start getting flavors that I didn't even put in there to begin with, and it's awesome. 
 I've definitely got a couple of yogurt flavors on my short list of flavors to buy. I may have to look into black currant as well.
If you haven't yet, check out TFA Dragonfruit. I was reading on the /r/DIY_eJuice that it contains a chemical that helps flavors blend, and so I grabbed some and tried it in my last batch of fruit and cream blends. Suffice it to say, it's going to be a main ingredient (in low percentages, .5 - 2%) in nearly all fruit blends going forward. Honestly, you barely notice it, but its effects are quite pronounced.
Also, not to shill too much, but give Mt. Baker flavors a try - I've been very impressed. 
 Made a 5ml test batch with the 3% blackberry option;  dripped a bit and it's nice.  I'll set the rest aside for a while and see what happens.  
Thanks for posting. 
 Just tried this out with 2% FLV vanilla custard added. Tastes decent off the bat, going to let it steep and see how it comes out. Thanks for the contribution.  
 /u/ZugZug_PugPug 
 I'll try this out when I order some new flavors. Thanks! 
 Sweet. Thanks for the inspiration! My first ever mix was a mango, tangerine, pineapple recipe that I found on ELR. It was definitely 'meh.' It was about time I messed with a man-tan combo again! 
 Hey just wanted to give an update. I got my flavors in and made this and it straight up tastes like redbull right away. I skipped the koolada cause I don't like mint and cool flavors too much, but at least for me I think the 1% is too much (even if it's only 1%). I'll try tweaking the mango and harvest berry up cause I think at least for my taste buds that will do the trick. 
 Hey thanks for the update! For me, I get more tangerine than anything at the moment. Harvest berry could definitely come up, IMO. Let me know what you come up with, cus I'm going to be playing with this for sure. But hey, you can taste it right?!  
Edit: oh and I want to try lychee instead of koolada...just have to order it.  
 Yeah I actually just got an RDA today (Plume veil clone) and it's awesome, the flavor is great and I can actually taste everything. Even my older mixes I made I could taste, which I couldn't with the tanks. 
I did make a mustard milk that I could taste in the tank so I may just stick to  that when I'm out and about, and everything else for when I'm at home.
I'll try some revision of the mix later and let ya know. I also wanted to try lychee cause I actually love the berry 
 yessssss! I just got Fittyz and its fucking awesome. Been vaping it all week. 
 Ohhhh, I wanted to try that Vanilla Almond Milk. Let us know how it is.  
 >Premium 
 Omg that vanilla almond is one of my favorite juices. It is so good! 
 MOO Liquids Vanilla Almond Milk is absolutely sublime, so smooth & creamy, just a touch of vanilla as an endnote to sweeten it up a tad, it's not VANILLA overwhelming like some lessor mixers use...  
Fittyz Doo-Wop rivils Rhillip Rocke's Strawberry creamsickle some other hundred words cream ejuice, again, smooth & creamy and at a far better price!  
Use code 406933760 for $5 off your 1st order @ejuicedirect.com 
 Try these two: 
6% Strawberry  
8% Vanilla Bean Ice Cream 
It's Fizzmustard's S&C recipe, a classic. 
Also, try this, which should be pretty good:
10% Watermelon 
4% Strawberry Ripe
1-2% Koolada/Menthol 
 If you can wait long enough to let the Fuzzmustard steep a week it'll blow your mind. 
 Thank you :) 
 MustardMilk, in my experience, is at LEAST a week before it's right. 2 is even better. 
 Try:
3% Vanilla Bean Icecream
2% strawberry Ripe or peach (I've only tried the juicy peach so this is a guess)
0.5% Marshmallow 
But it won't be a s&amp;v but if you really are in a hurry you can try the crockpot method I and a day later it should be ok. I know it's sacrilege and nothing beats a proper steep but if you are desperate something is better than a smoke. 
Edit. Just saw you want fruity. Sorry can't help.  
 Thank you, even if it's not fruity I'll still give it a go! 
 I haven't tried orange cream yet, but you probably aren't going to get any bright fruity flavors out of it. I would try mixing strawberry, blueberry, and vanilla bean ice cream. That's always good. Might take a day to steep though. Shake and vapes are kind of a subjective thing, some people need to steep longer to enjoy their juice. With the three flavors I suggested, I would vape away after a day or two. Good luck.  
 Thank you :) 
 Just a quick and easy recipe:
6% TFA Strawberry, 5% TFA Watermelon.
Very simple but refreshing and clean mix. No sweeteners needed.
Sorry if this is to basic for y'all, one of my favorite simple mixes. 
 Nothing is too basic :) Thank you for sharing, I'll whack it on to my 'to make' list for the weekend.  
 Man, I've never had that exact Time Bomb Julius, but for something orange julius similar, I would try:
* 3.5% orange cream
* 5% vanilla bean ice cream
I know it sounds deceptively simple, but some things are exactly that.  I actually have a bottle right now that's 3.5% orange cream and 5% bavarian cream, and it's really good.  Don't think that the ice cream would be too different from the bavarian.  Maybe a touch of koolada if you wanted the cooling sensation.  Oh, and the orange has gotten much more potent over time, so if it's kinda mild right at first, don't be too tempted to increase the orange until you've tried it a week on. 
 Thanks mate - it's on the list to try once I sort out this bloody griffin RTA, everything I make right now tastes burnt so holding off on anything new until I can get the coils down.  
 I had that problem too initially and found it didn't play well with the claptons I put in(not blaming the wire, that's just what happened). I switched it out for very simple single wire builds since and it works great 
 Try adjusting the amount of wicking material?  I had that once.  Wasn't putting enough cotton.  I guess it was drying up too fast. 
 Theres a company called Cloudz 4 Dayz and their January is similar. Not a dead ringer, but if you love delta as much as me, itll do as far as a cheaper version. 
 Might as well try for a fancy vape shot. 
Here's the setup I've been using for a week or so now - aromamizer rdta 6ml with rx200. I've been loving it (upgraded from evic vtc mini with the starter kit ego one mega tank):
http://imgur.com/VooxKAk
I'm vaping a mix of [[silly rabbit]] and [[redstone]], about 70% silly rabbit and 30% redstone. It seems to add some really nice candy-watermelon sweetness to the front without making it ruined as a cereal vape. 
Anyway, thanks for the chance :). I'm in IT, not law enforcement, so no gear shots unless you feel like a picture of my way too fucking cluttered desk. 
 Live the chance to win flavors you might never buy.  That's how it gain a customer and advertising.  
 I'm currently in class so I can't post any crazy shit so I'll just say: Thanks bby. 
 Clouds are friends not foe. 
 So I made twisted 28g coils for the first time the other day [I like them](https://www.instagram.com/p/BBLgEgAlNK5/) 
 Let's do this! 
 Strawberry Kiwi sounds tasty 
 Thanks for the opportunity, and good luck everyone 
 This is my mod: http://inspirevapes.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/IMG_07831.jpg  But it's authentic
I'm not in Law enforcement but I'm studying to get an Associates in Fire Tech 
 Hell yeah, I recommend dual twisting 26G, I am from 28 and trust me the vape is a lot better in my opinion! 
 I'm down! 
 I'm definitely in� 
 Green Crack  
 Sweet! I really love your guys' labels. 
 My major right now is Criminal Justice and I plan to be a probation/parole officer or corrections officer and I vape. 
 Hell yeah for corrections. Just remember it's not all about get into your cell! Bitch! There's a lot more to it then meets the eye. 
 Oh that I am fully aware of!  
 Hey just saying :) it was a shock to me how much work it was, if you never listen to any advice, listen to this. (Considering you do get a law enforcement job) Decompress before you leave work, while your in the parking lot or wherever all your coworkers might be, just talk to each other about the day, get all your bitching out and talk it out, laugh a lot while doing it. Because if you don't, you'll be taking it home and that can ruin your home life. We deal with real life shit, people don't realize the mental strain these jobs put on us, they may think that we are exaggerating when we talk about how mentally and physically tiring it is. Keep only friends that understand that your career is a career not a job, and they should respect that. 
Also, if you don't document it, you didn't do it. 
 Thats amazing advice. I have heard to keep work at work and home home because in this field mixing the two does not end well. Once I turn 21 (im 20) I am going to see if there are any part time Correction jobs around here to get into. Ill have to do an internship at some point too. I am so excited  
 Really? Where I work all I had to do was apply and go through the steps, no schooling or interning or anything required, only the academy and they send us. And you gotta be 18 not 21 (I'm 24).
Yeah, this job has the highest suicide and divorce rate of anybody else in the world. Every 22 hours a LEO commits suicide. Keeping work at work and home at home is easier said than done.
Do not allow home life to affect work life and vis versa, it. will. not. end. well. Trust me I did it already, you become complacent at work which is a major, major safety risk. And at home you become agitated, angry, depressed and that can cause your family to leave, it can happen. That's why I say, before you leave that parking lot, hang out a little while and just bull shit around with other officers, for example. Hey man, you will not believe what happen today! This stupid ass mother fucker tried to say that his tray wasn't right, I know for a fact he was bull shitting. Stupid bitch slung his tray across the fucking pod and said get me a new tray! I told him that because he threw his tray, 2 things were gonna happen. He wasn't getting a new one and he was being taken to SEG 
The other officers understand you better in the professional world than your momma does at home. They know what your going through, even if it's some small petty ass shit, get it off your chest. Then on your way home, open them Windows and blast some music and let it all out. 
Also keep in good shape, do not let yourself go.
And last piece of advice, I know we harp on Reddit a lot for being grammar nazis. Listen to them, when your writing a report, which as you should know is a legal document that can be subpoenaed to court, even a missing comma or apostrophe can change the whole meaning of your report. Missing a word, or mis phrasing something or writing in incomplete or even to lengthy sentences can change the whole meaning in court, and a defense attorney if your being sued for whatever reason because the guy you wrote a report up on did something and he named you in the lawsuit, an attorney will eat you up and spit out back out and ask for seconds. It can't hurt to go online and take a refreshing English 101 type thing. We literally had an English class on Monday this week in the academy for this reason. 
 Well you don't have to have a degree unless you want to do parole, probation, or some other administrative jobs within the prison and the university I go to requires an internship. 
Oh wow I was not aware of the grammar/written report being used against you aspect. That is wonderful to know. I am worried because I have Fibromyalgia so I am in constant pain. I do work currently in retail so I am used to being on my feet, but I hope that won't affect my chances of being hired anywhere. I am in a 100 level English class currently and it's helping a ton. I still have a lot of work to do though.
This is the best and most honest advice I have ever received and I thank you for it.  
 Hell yeah. If you ever have questions feel free to contact me I'm always open and available to help people 
 Awesome, thanks! 
 Awesome giveaway, could really use the juice! Thanks for the chance! 
 Cool giveaway 
 I just graduated college with honors for my law enforcement certification. I'm going to attend academy in 2 years as it comes up every 2 years. 
 Cool! Love seeing new vendors around 
 Thanks! 
 Count me in!  
 Thanks 
 Sweet! 
 I don't have anything clever or interesting to say, thanks for the giveaway 
 I know it's not a pick your own flavor but Green Crack sounds so good right now,  thanks for the chance :)  
 Just tried my first ever clapton coil, and oh man the hype is real. This single coil 0.6ohm clapton at 50w is producing more vapor & flavor than my dual coil builds at the same ohms/wattage.  
 Anything 
 I made this: http://imgur.com/Tqe8AAL 
 Looks dope! Too bad if I win I'll run the whole line in a couple days. TFV4 driiiiinks. 
 Thanks! 
 Got my Kangertech Topbox Mini last week and still new to trying to find the right juice as a new vaper. Thanks for the chance! 
 A billion lives 
 Damnit, I'm probably too late.  I just saw the thread.. ah well. 
 Just getting into vaping and I'm amazed at the sheer number of flavors out there. This would be an awesome way to get started trying them. 
 I'm pretty close to blowing myself up with these builds. If it does happen I'll say that I was vaping Bomb BombZE juice when it happened /s 
 In Law Enforcement we call this projecting. It's when you pass blame onto another party or parties in an attempt to clear yourself from any responsibility in the incident ;)
 
 I'm not trying to say it was the juices fault but more of a way to sponsor the brand.  
 I had a great time at the 2016 NHL Fan Fair in Nashville during the weekend. 
 [Here](http://imgur.com/gU7NpKD) is my vape set-up. And [Here](http://imgur.com/iFxiiNo) was my first attempt at a Zipper coil. Just a couple pictures to make my entry a tiny tiny bit less boring. Lol.
----
I also just wanna say that I myself am not in Law Enforcement.. But I have a really really high respect for all those who are..  I really wish more people would take the time to just thank all, or even just one or two, of our world's law enforcement persons.
----
Thanks so much for the giveaway! Northern Lights from Bomb Bombz is probably in my top 10 favorite juices of all time. :) Keeping my fingers tightly crossed. Good luck everyone! Much love and vape on. <3 
 Thanks for the appreciation. I've been a sworn officer for almost a year now, I'll graduate the Police Academy for Corrections on just about my one year, to become a Certified Jail Officer. 
I wish everybody could take just one week to shadow a shift of both road deputies and jail officers, and then do a one month boot camp type ordeal where you learn the basics of what we do.
This is a good site to read over what we actually have to learn and perform everyday [All 113 pages](http://www.dcjs.virginia.gov/standardsTraining/compulsoryMinimumTraining/cjsmanual-LAWCH5_PerformanceJO.pdf). My training I'm doing now is probably gonna be closer to 1500-2000 pages of information, plus testing and stuff once I'm complete. [Give this site a good scan when your bored doing nothing sometime](http://www.dcjs.virginia.gov) 
 You know, I'll probably read all (or, a lot of) those 113 pages.. =P It's good to know what a person goes through to become someone in Law enforcement, and also what they do on a day to day basis. Thanks for the info, it's always good to know more. :)
&nbsp;
And I wish you good luck/early congratulations/happiness on your journey into corrections!
Thanks again for this awesome giveaway. Much love and vape on! 
 This would be an awesome way to start vaping, just picked up my first setup! 
 I work with the developmentally disabled. It's sort of like police work, with more poop. 
 I do, as well. It was my first job ever, and have been doing it ever since. (With a couple customer service jobs in between.)  I have many people tell me, I just don't know how you do it and I could never ever do anything like that.
But damn, it's great work. I love it. I love the people I work with. It's feel good work. It's hard work, but rewarding. Yeah, there's some gross stuff but.. that just makes it more exciting, right? =P 
 Hey I know all about that, respect to you!  
 Hellz ya I'm in! 
 What a great giveaway! Fingers crossed!  
 Thanks! 
 Awesome giveaway! Thanks 
 I hope this is still open
 
 My brother recently did his testing to get into the academy, and I have a whole family full of law enforcement. They have a bad image as a whole but we certainly know there are many good ones out there. Much luck to you and be safe! 
 Your juices sound awesome. Thanks for the giveaway!  
 I hope it's not too late. 
My vape story isn't much of a story, but a statement/mild rant. 
I started vaping to get off of cigs, and yes, I'm a cloud chaser... But I'm not a douche about it. I'm starting to dislike (yet find them funny because I'm not in THAT category per-say) the memes/videos downing vapers. I don't get offended by them; it's just the fact that I can automatically be labeled as a tool while having my mod in hand. Yet I do it for my health, not cool points.  
 Whoop whoop giveaway! It's cool to see peeps from all walks of life vaping it up!! 
 Vape life fuck cigs 
 Just got out of boot camp and looking for some juice to try, this would be awesome!  
 You should check out BRV!
They are a veteran owned vape company and all of their 30ML(?) bottles are $17.76! (Get it?) plus they taste GREAT!
[Link to BRV](https://brvliquids.com) 
 That's pretty sweet! I'll definitely check that out thank you! 
 I like juice 
 I was a pretty heavy smoker. Vaping for 1 month now and haven't had a cigarette since. Really enjoying it! 
 Just spilled my recent 30ml bottle all over my passenger seat ;_; 
 ANYTHING!
Yeah! 
 The monk RDA arrived today. So excited! :D 
 I have been needing more juice for my mvp itaste 3.0 with the arctic tank for quite a while :( 
 This sounds like a grand ol' time.  I'd love to give you guys a try.  
 I am in!! 
 I want juice  
 I definitely feel you on the difficulty on getting into law enforcement these days. I'm getting ready to apply for the second time. Anyway here is the little setup I have, it's not as spiffy as others, but tis mine. http://imgur.com/a/be3qN 
 Thanks for the opportunity!
 
 Count me in! 
 Ayee lemme get some of this beast juice ;) 
 More free stuff? I love freebies, because more often than not I later end up spending waaayyy too much money on their stuff later.
 
 Well, that's why I put together and organize these giveaways. When we giveaway a small amount, there is going to be some exposure to the vendor. When you get a small amount of exposure, people will buy stuff and tell friends/shops ECt, then more exposure and sales ECt. It's a way to help these companies out! 
 Cool logo! 
 Well, my vape story is this. I'm sitting in my local B&M when these two twins from the local high school come in. No big deal, they're of age, no issues. Well they come in asking about different mods for sale and such when one of them pulls out this beat to shit mech mod. Everything is lose, battery rattle sounds like a rattlesnake. He then starts to explain how he bought it for a hundred and ten dollars and not only does it barely function, it started on fire not one time, but two seperate occasions and he still used it. I exchange a look with the owner that I'm friends with and he immediately starts telling them to look at what he has in stock. They then proceed to say how it's too expensive and walk out of the store. 
Thanks for the giveaway. 
 These look great! Thanks for the giveaway guys! Best of luck to all involved. 
 [Crack is so overrated....](https://imgflip.com/i/yfppz)

 [Here](http://imgur.com/a/7Q1rd) is a picture of my daughter and her new hat that she found. She likes getting into her 5 year old brothers stuff. Not vape related, but she does try and take my mod from me.  
 My dad is a reserve officer who just had his knee replaced. He's the one who got me into vaping.  
 Thanks for the giveaway  
 Joining thanks for the opportunity  
 Woo 
 Cool! Thanks! 
 You are like the Vaped Crusader. Props 
 Thanks for the opportunity! 
 Max vg 
 If it's free, it's for me. 
 Never too soon for a juice pickmeup 
 Cool 
 aditional cigarettes on the 4th of Jan using a Kangertech Subvod and loving every minute of it! 
 D'oh - dunno what went wrong with my submission, I said I gave up traditional cigarettes... 
 This one time at vape camp.... 
 This would be awesome. 
 Thank you very much! 
 In just 3 days I will be smoke free for 2 years. Thanks!  
 Dang, nice. Congrats.  
 id love to win these, thanks for the chance, man! :D  
 I'm excited. I've got a bottle of God's Gift that I'm vaping on right now. My local B&M just got you guys back in stock. It's fantastic.  
 good luck everyone 
 I don't have a picture to post, but I vape and I'm in Corrections in Alaska! Just getting in to new flavors from vendors, I typically make my own.  
 Herp 
 Yes! A chance to check out a new vendor, cool labels too! Count me in :)  
 Not law enforcement, but.. http://imgur.com/7f3gpVn 
 Thanks for doing this. It's now been over a month since I had a cigarette, and I'm so very glad that I have! Now I've been trying new flavors, and food actually tastes good! I'm so glad that I started vaping

 Uh this giveaway has been unstickied and a post made about it being done at the top of the main post. We have a new giveaway posted  
 oh
 
 those labels are looking mighty fine! 
 I'm a bit torn lately on my vape habits. 
I looooove those big beasts of a cloud lately. Like the kind that blot out the sun so you can fight in the shade. 
Lately I've been dropping down my nice level to zero so I don't get all light headed when I do. And here comes the issue. I don't want to vape in public places. I feel like an obnoxious asshat with clown shoes when I vape around other people. I think I ought to get a separate setup. Have one for home vaping on the toilet and a separate one that I don't feel bad about using in public. I feel like I might be missing out on opportunities to talk to smokers about the benefits of vaping versus smoking. Just trying to be respectful and share all this love I got. 
 
 Hopefully I made it in time! 
 You did!

 Right now I'm rocking the Reuleaux RX200 with the SMOK TFV4 using its RDA with a 0.7 ohm coil at 38 watts and boy can you get some huge clouds off that sucker!! I just checked out Blacknote line and would love to try me some Bomb BombZ!! :3 
 I'm Zeb, and I'm a legend.  
 got a lot of vape toys in mail tomorrow and im soooo psyched for my griffin rta! 
 I REALLY love me some sweet flavors. This definitely sounds right up my alley.
For my submission I'm attaching a crappy little joke project I did in highschool for a Utopian Society. It's rather hilarious and definitely worth a read. Did I forget to mention that the residents praise a catapult!?!?!?!?
Good luck to everyone else entering.

 Omg this is awesome. Thanks for the opportunity! :) Best wishes everyone good luck! 
 Just quit analogs after 10+ years of about 2 packs a day.   Purchased an eGo one CT as my first rig. I have to say the people I've met at a local vape lounge and the online community have made me a huge supporter of vaping. Can't wait to start building my first mod!  Definitely a life changing experience for me thus far.   
 Thanks for the opportunity! Good luck at Academy!  
 Down to give this a try thanks for the giveaway 
 Not law enforcement, but am a security guard and vape...  I can have a little more facial hair than y'all can haha
Edit: I'm the asshole that has to tell people to move their car from the fire lane bc its illegal to park there.  I wouldn't have to tell you to move if you would read the bright red sign on the curb that says NO PARKING  FIRE LANE

 Don't know if its too late but that lineup looks awesome, also good luck on your Academy! I have a friend in corrections, i remember the days he was in the Academy we barely saw him.   
 Got a new tank that needs some new flavor!! 
 Awesome logo. Would love to try one out. 
 Sounds awesome 
 Still open?  
 The worst juice I ever vaped was a home-brew pizza flavor. It did taste like pizza. Very unfortunately. 
 That sounds like the second-worst tasting juice I've ever heard of. Eeeugch. The first of course being that crab juice.. =P 
 Dammit Jim, I want some juice.  
 Just got my new Coolfire 4 Plus and I love it! Its the silver one, so shiny!

 Sweet thanks for the shot ! 
 meeee 
 I wanna do this so bad... 
 Good job! How'd they come out?  
 how did you make them? did you buy extracts online and use those? 
 Hey sorry just saw this, but it was honestly so simple. I found a local shop online where they sold VG, flavour concentrates, and nicotine base and besides syringes and bottles thats all you literally need. I'm from Canada but I was so surprised at the amount of online shops that have DIY juice supplies, http://www.flavourfog.com/ and http://www.diy-ejuice.com/ were great. Then go to http://e-liquid-recipes.com/ pick your recipe and get your supplies!  
 B-X Vapors 
 One of my all time favorites 
 this one has to be the best. plus they are awesome! i bought 2 120Ml bottle, l and they send a third bottle. A full 120Ml, 3Mg, 80 vg% bottle of horchata
 
 Just ordered a 30Ml of this and they sent a 50Ml. I love these guys. 
 That rocks! 
 Ninja edit because I was in a state of euphoria. What I meant to say is that I won a coupon in one of their give-aways. Ordered 3 30ml's for $6.50 with shipping. They upgraded 2 to 50Ml's. BTW, the horchata smells amazing. Check em out: http://b-xvapor.com/ 
 This one is amazing. 
 TBD Liquid has an horchata flavor. I actually just got it in yesterday and will be trying it out tomorrow. 
 Sweet let me know how that is 
 Hey so I've been vaping this for a few hours now. It's not bad.
I have 3mg max vg (no steeping) which mellows out the cinnamon on the inhale but its super creamy/milky on exhale which tastes like legitimate horchata to me (albeit a bit muted probably due to the vg ratio).
All in all, not too bad. I'm going to let it sit a week or two after this tank and roll with it then.
 
 Nice I'll def check that one out. Thanks! 
 http://vapecaviar.com/products/plume-juice-120ml?variant=6419320773  
  
120ml for $20 
 This doesn't taste very good if you get a fresh batch, but trust me and give it a few weeks. It goes from a dry cinnamon bland yet somewhat harsh vape to a sweet (but not cloyingly so) cinnamon with just the tight touch of vanilla - it also somehow manages to hit that weird rice-water flavor in the background. 
Seriously, its fantastic. Trying it fresh, I just wanted to toss it. I'm glad I didn't and gave it another chance, because it's actually a great flavor. 
 Unicorn Porn by Juice Man is a Strawberry Horchata flavor. I got it in my Zamplebox this month... The strawberry is subtle, and the rice flavor is strong on the exhale. I like it a lot 
 Oooo that sounds nice. I'll def check that out thanks! 
 Vaper Jungle - Horchata Custard 
 Cape Fear Juice Company - Chicora. It's Horchata for sure.  
 I tried a bunch, this was best: http://dndvapor.com/collections/e-liquid/products/horchata-e-liquid (Needs no steeping IMO)
Second best: http://b-xvapor.com/products/horchata-tas (Needs 2-4 weeks steeping)
 
 I like Vape Force 1's Horchata. I think they're like a sub company of a bigger company that specializes for discounts to vets.
They have some other good flavors but I think that Horchatta is right up your alley. 
 UPDATE: They do sell the flavor here: https://www.vaping-paradise.de/aroma-waldfrucht
In case anyone is interested :) 
 Its in german? and im on moble but I think this is it https://www.vaping-paradise.de/e-liquid/high-class-xtra-liquid
https://www.vaping-paradise.de/e-liquid-waldfrucht 
 Oh, nice! I might as well try this, they do have the flavor I want. 
Thank you very much!
But it does seem like they sell ready liquid for vaping, not just the flavor. I am not quite sure. It makes no sense to choose nicotine levels for flavors, and they do. :[ 
 I don't understand what it is you want.  
 Flavoring, not e-juice. Just the flavor that is used to apply on a flavorless nic base. They seem to sell ready e-liquid in 10ml bottles, or so it seems, because they offer nicotine mg choice, which makes no sense for flavoring. 
 It looks to me that that sell ejuice. That you just put in your tank. That's why there's a nic level.
The flavouring probably isn't for sale. It's kinda like trademark flavours. 
And, you know you have to put it in PG/VG, right? Not nicotine. The nic is added separately. 
 Yeah, I am not a vaping noob, just looking for a place that sells this particular flavor. I see that I made the mistake in my title by writing juice, but I am after the flavor in particular. I already wrote an e-mail to that site, asking if they have just the flavoring concentrate. 
Thanks, though, they might end up having it, or pointing me towards a place that does have it.
Worst case scenario - I will just find a new flavor that is sold with high supply around the local shops, or something easier to find and order online. :)
 
 Good luck to you, mate.

JAC Vapour raspberry is my all-time favourite followed by cartomator crush by epic clouds and then gingerbread brulee by grumpy juice if you're looking for any ideas!  
 My shipping was $3.75.  
 Paid 4.50 just for shipping. Can't complain for 30ml of juice 
 Their juice is damn good and I have a review coming soon.

 Those are some great choices you made there!  
 I have been enjoying everything so far, haven't even got to try them all yet as I mostly use tanks not drippers. 
 I agree with /u/Roxasthenobody. Sample pack would be clutch. I also been on the hunt for a bomb cinnamon toast crunch flavor to recommend to friends. Hook it up man! 
 I will take the sample pack idea into consideration (figure out pricing, etc.). PM me your address info and I'll try to get you some once more labels come in. 
 Looks quite interesting! Loopy madness sounds good! 
 I'll extend the offer to you as well. PM me your address and I'd be willing to send a sample your way as well.  
 Thank you very much! And I'll pm you in just a few. 
 Did you take down the preview? 
 Yea the site just says opening soon? 
 yeah. I had too. I didn't want to disappoint anyone if they placed an order because my label company fell through on production, and now I'm having to wait an extra two weeks. I changed product on hand to zero so no one could buy anything and then be disappointed when their order wasn't fulfilled for another two weeks. I remember the opening soon page. Feel free to take a look now. 
 Nice dat good good sounds like its right up my alley! Ill book mark your page and come back to see when you are opening! 
 I'm with everyone else Dat good good sounds like it's gonna be on point. I've always liked the milk 2 from teleos but felt like it was always missing something in it. 
 To anyone who I promised a sample: The labels have finally arrived. Will be shipping by the end of this week! Honest feedback would be greatly appreciated! 
 Hella awesome, mate.  
 [deleted] 
 That's exactly what its for. I got tired of all the premium juice that tastes great but produces mediocre clouds.. Pm me a flavor you would like to try and your address and depending on spare money this month i possibly could swing some free swag. 
 I've been looking for a clone of mad hatter i love cookies. Found nothing so far.  
 That may be as cheap as you are going to find.  You can always try Vapewild and Mt Baker Vapor. 
 I agree. That's about as cheap as you'll find. Seems like a pretty unique flavor too.   
 That adk cascade is awesome. I have a 250ml bottle too.  
 Quick question. When you shake your Giant Vapors Juice, does it get all foamy at the top? Like the head on a freshly poured beer? 
 No I don't have that problem with the Giant Vapor flavors I have.  I have had that problem before with another juice that had lemon juice in it.  What flavor do you have? 
 Lemon Cake. 
 They probably added lemon juice to the mix, when ever I add lemon juice to my DIY juices It gets a foamy head like that when you shake it, however with steeping it does seem to go away.  Other then that does it taste good? 
 Thank you! I had no idea. 
 I too have 120mls of cascade. 
 I love Cascade I need to reup my ADK juices though I need some Cayuga and Saratoga.  cough cough (that's 250mls ;) 
 Have you tanked it ever? I usually drip it but Kinda want to tank it. 
 Yeah I almost always have a sub-tank full of it :) 
 Yes it does! 
 Discount apply to some one that did 10 years and is out now? 
 Juice is way too harsh compared to other cheap brands like Hobo Joe's or You Got E Juice 
 it seems strange that they say the part about one can ever resist. i thought it was a typo until i saw it copied and pasted in the comments a few times. Has anyone tried these? i searched /r/ejuicereviews and did not get results. i admit my Redditisfun app has been a little buggy lately though... 
 Impressive blog post 
 This blog post is not impressive.  
 Impressive in my mind.......what ever you can?
It's my opinion. 
 The spammers are communicating with each other now ahhhhhhhh 
 Sorry Coolloser,
I am a Two-Year Club member and you are new in Reddit.
So, mind your language. Sorry to say. I know what is spam. 
 Judging by your comment karma of a whopping 17, I'd say you're wrong about knowing the difference between engaging people on Reddit or spamming links. 
 How funny! 
 It's really just not a good blog post. 
 I Loved E-Juice :)  
 You have 3 years above their 2 years so I'm inclined to agree with you. ;) 
 *Drops mic* 
 Just mark the contents of the box as gift or specialty polish and you have better chances. I ordered from US to Finland and didn't get any hassle for my package, and I had over 200ml juice in it. 
 Looks tasty. Thanks! 
 10% CAP vanilla custard V1 - what? let alone that this is crazy not good for you, how in the world is this vapable right after mixing?  
 It tastes perfectly fine to me. After a steep it may be too overpowering, but as a shake and vape it's very good.  
 Crazy not good for me  
Please tell me more... 
 The V1 contains Diacetyl and possibly other related Diketones. Which have been accepted as dangerous to Vape.  The V2 doesn't contain these but doesn't taste as good.  So it's a choice you have to make. But I'd read up on it and decide for yourself 
 Sorry, it was 7am and I was feeling sarcastic.  Diacetyl hasn't been proven to have any harmful effects when vaporized.  The VERY FEW cases of popcorn lung that EVER surfaced where from people who had been exposed to thousands of times more of the compound than we (as vapers) could ever be exposed to.  
Vape the stuff.  It's delicious. 
 I never said it was Proven I said it was Accepted as hazardous to inhale.   It has been a topic of controversy since the beginning but as far as I see it, why would companies go through the process of rigorous testing of these flavor concentrates to come to the conclusion that a Diketone free version of these flavors was necessary. I am not telling anyone that they should or shouldn't consume these products but they should read up on the products they are putting into their bodies.  
 If there wasn't so many people and organizations trying to end vaping, them there wouldn't have been a diacetyl scare at all yet. Vaping is a very heavily self-policed industry. The tests were done so that there would be complete transparency in the industry and have the facts laid out for the haters.  
 Actually, the controversy is 1/5th of the age of the vape industry.  Only in the last 2 years or so has the topic even been discussed.  Juice makers had been putting V1 flavorings in their juices for YEARS.  
They broke down and tested because HYPE TRAIN GET ON!
But yes, I agree, education is key. 
 I'm completely aware of the diketones in it. To be blunt, I just don't really care. I smoked a 1/2 PAD and didn't care then, so why should I care about flavoring components that haven't even been proven harmful? 
 Did you know there was a time when we put lead in our gas and burned it in our cars then realized it actually poisoned everyone.. lol 
 All those cases of popcorn lung smokers... 
 There was also a time when we accused people of practicing witchcraft. 
 This sounds amazing. Fuji is my favorite flavor and I'm always looking for new ways to use it, so thank you. Will be trying it very soon.  
 Fuji is my favorite variety of apple, so to have a flavor that is so true to it is awesome. Please report back then! I'm going to experiment with some spearmint next instead of menthol...just made a guava mojito and I'm loving the spearmint/lime combo right now. 
 It took me forever to get around to it because of so many other things I was working on, but I finally made this and it is terrific. Thanks for sharing it. 
I made it without any menthol. I could probably vape this all day already, but it's my nature to constantly try to improve everything, so next time I'll try it with just a little less cactus, maybe 0.3%.  
 Hey you're welcome. I really appreciate the feedback! I haven't made this in a little bit because I have just been cranking out new recipes like mad, but I'm going to go ahead and revisit it. I will go without menthol, cut that cactus to .3% and add 1% marshmallow. 
 Right now it's easily one of my top two or three favorite shake-and-vapes, even without cutting the cactus a hair. But in case you're wondering how it holds up to steeping for a week... It still tastes great, because I'm a lime fan, but the lime comes to the front so hard it should be called Tahitian Lime with maybe a slight hint of apple. So yummy fresh there's no good reason why a 15ml batch should last a week, though.  
 I'm glad you are liking it. I've been noticing this with lime Tahiti cp. I'm going to make a project out of taming this bad boy. Have any suggestions? I'm thinking about drastically lowering the initial percentage as a starting point.  
 It's so good as shake and vape I'm afraid lowering the lime by a lot will detract from that. Maybe lowering it just a little and see how that goes? Maybe substituting the lime for some other lime/citrus flavor that might not get stronger over time... Or just sticking to smaller batches and always vaping it up before Tahiti Lime Cold-Pressed starts bullying all the other flavors. It's also possible that all it needs is a longer steep than six days. People on /r/DIY_eJuice have mentioned mixes tasting alright freshly shaken, nasty after a week, and fantastic after two weeks. Maybe this is one of those kinda deals.  
 Update 1: I tried cutting the lime to 2%. I feel that the cactus definitely needs to come down now...probably by half. I will see how it tastes after steeping.  
 Thanks for the feedback. I shall mess with it and let you know what I find.  
 do you think this would still be awesome menthol-less? 
 Totally. If it feels too top-heavy, I would add a bit of marshmallow. I recently got marshmallow and this just occurred to me so I shall mix it tonight and report back. 
 I've never mixed before but i ordered all the stuff to mix this(minus menthol, plus marshmallow before you even said that) and the stuff to mix another recipe with a couple less flavors 
 Welcome to DIY! So far, I mixed this up with 0.5% FA marshmallow and it turned out pretty nice. What marshmallow did you order?  
Edit: I would be interested to see what happens with a bit more marshmallow 
 apparently i forgot cap sweet strawberry from both sites i ordered from, i went back and ordered it. still waiting on nicotine too. i did get inawara shisha strawberry though. im still not going to be able to mix a damn thing because i cant seem to keep this bottle of fuji apple out of my nose 
 Isn't it heavenly? Shisha sounds interesting. I might pick that up. Just go ahead and mix up some of that Fuji at 3%...you know you want to! 
 i ordered FA marshmallow and was planning on trying it at 1% 
 Nice choice! I think that should work out pretty good.  
 TFA Watermelon is OK by itself and would be shake and vape-able at about 7-10%.
You could try
7% CAP Vanilla Custard
5% CAP Sweet Strawberry
3% TFA Cheesecake Graham Crust 
 /u/BuryMeInSmoke already said more or less what I came to say.
I'm really enjoying this one:
* 4% Cap Sweet Strawberry
* 4% TFA Ripe Strawberry
* 8% Cap Vanilla Custard
but if you use 8% Strawberry Sweet it should be good
I also like to use 0.5% INW Cactus and 1% TFA Marshmallow to smooth it out and give a juicier mouth feel, but this isn't completely necessary.  Just something to think about when you get around to another order. 
 You can go [here](http://e-liquid-recipes.com) and do some research. 
 Just wanted to say thanks for this sub, been looking for something like it for a while. Love making the complicated long steep juices but sometimes just need something I can Shake & Vape. 
 Anytime :)  Welcome to r/ShakeAndVape 
 My berry crunch is currently inbound and due to arrive Friday, definitely trying this, thanks! 
 I've not found many shake and vapes that I like but this one is good to go my friend  
 Very impressed, tried with TPA raspberry and then mango. Love it, thanks again! 
 anytime brother  
 2%sweet cream as a shake and vape? Not sure I could do that one without steeping at least a day. That stuff is so funky to me until it steeps. Tastes like feet to me! Haha. After a few days though...super-creamy tastiness. 
 You are right most any fruit will mix into this, I've done FA Apple, FA Cherry & a combo of the two.....all good.
Thanks this goes into my lineup. 
 Sweet cream contains butyric acid, bavarian cream contains diketones. When the two are vaped together, the diketones will stick around longer and do more naughty things in your lungs/to your body :( 
just thought i would let you guys know that... source: nude nicotine.  
 cool thanks for the heads up!  
 Just made this adding TFA Strawberry ripe at 4% and 1% FA strawberry. This is fantastic!!! 
 awesome :) 
been rinsing this while I've got 800ml of various flavours steeping  
 Any suggestions on a sub for bavarian cream? I really dislike that flavoring for some reason... Maybe something vanilla like vanilla custard or vanilla bean ice cream?  
 yeah that might work 
 Have you tryed anything with their vanilla overload conc i bought 30ml of it and dont know if i should mix it straight 15% or treat it like an ingredient like all other flavoringa 
 My impression is that the premixed concentrates fare well at 7-10%. Start at 7% and work your way up :)
It's meant to be a stand-alone vape but I'm sure it will work great in a mix. 
 Sweet been wondering this since i bought it thanks for help! 
 I have always struggled with my watermelons tasting like candy, but I will certainly give INW Cactus a try in it now. Thanks! 
 Most of my fruit mixes have cactus in them these days, just to bump up that juicy mouth feel.  
 2% kaktus though!  I feel like .5% is strong haha 
 You're not the first person to say that.  I started out at 1% and went up from there.   
 I really love lemon e-liquids as well, but find lemon flavorings difficult to work with in DIY.  There are so many lemon flavorings available, but they can generally take over a juice pretty fast and some of them just aren't very good.   
I have found FA Lemon Sicily to be good, as well as INW Lemon Mix and INW Lemon Concentrate.  All three of these should be used at low percentages (2-3% Max).  
I've never had Lemon Sugar Cookie, but have some good recipes for lemon mint, lemon sorbet, and lemon meringue.  
u/botboy141 has a great recipe for lemon sorbet over on r/DIY_EJUICE.  It is better than any other lemon juice I've ever had.  Good as a shake and vape, but devine after a week to 10-days of steeping.  I can highly recommend it.  I try to keep 30-60mls mixed up at all times!   
 I posted a recipe to Frosted Lemon Cookies a while back. It's not 100% shake n vape, it tastes best after a day or two, but I always vape it and enjoy it on the same day I make it. Here you go. You could sub FA Lemon Sicily for the Cap Juicy Lemon, though you'll probably take a smaller percentage (3ish I think) for it. Haven't tried any other lemons. 
If you want to create your own, I would start with the Lemon, add Biscuit and Cookie in small percentages, and then add some creams and Meringue to it to round out the flavor. Hope that helps! 
http://e-liquid-recipes.com/recipe/236226/Frosted+Lemon+Cookies 
 The vanilla custard you have listed in that recipe doesn't indicate vendor.. I assume you mean CAP Vanilla Custard v1? 
 Yeah it's cap Vanilla Custard V1 - I've had trouble getting the right one up before in ELR for it, so oops lol.  
 Thanks for confirming. I've been looking for a good lemon cookie. 
 I like this alot. I've also been experimenting with a Lemon bar type flavor - this is what I have for it so far if you want to experiment. I won't say it's amazing yet, but it's a decent vape. Here's a link: 
http://e-liquid-recipes.com/recipe/280626/Lemon+Bar 
 I currently only have FA lemon sicily. I tend to find it kind of disappears in the mix after steeping.
I see you use CAP juicy lemon quite a bit. Does that hold up better?
Will have to grab some and try out your mixes. That cap JL is the only thing I'm missing. 
 Yeah I really like Juicy Lemon, it's a great sweet lemon flavor that seems to hold up well, where I use the Lemon Sicily as an accent on the Lemon. If you have another lemon than Lemon Sicily, give that a try to replace the Cap Juicy Lemon at whatever percentage is right for that flavoring, it might work out well. 
 Delicious. Rating (probably because I'm new-ish to making flavors) : 4/5 
 hellz yes. i second the 4/5 grade.  
 Honestly, a good juice. Tastes almost premium lol
 
 yep. im gonna be trying his recipes later today since he had such a dope one here. just wait till tomorrow! that peach comes out and shines on day 2!!
btw: i gotta great laugh at the subs you help moderate. HA! 
 Lol feel free to subscribe to any of them :p
 
 yeah my gf would have a fucking stroke next time she checked out some recipes or something in diy. lmfao 
 Hahaha! 
 
 Either way I'm sure it's delicious. I would personally call this a (short)cake of some sort. Semantics, meh.  
 I added in 2% FW Cake (Yellow) into a 15 mL batch of this and named it Simple Strawberry Shortcake (adapted from rwm5236@reddit) in my DIY e-juice master spreadsheet where I keep all of the recipes I make or use. It definitely works well as a strawberry shortcake as-is, but IMO it still needs some tweaking to get it perfect.
Thanks for sharing the recipe, rwm5236! 
 Have you tried TFA vanilla custard? Been mixing it at 8% with your go to fruit along with 2% graham cracker clear and 2% Bavarian cream. Tastes great as a shake and vape. Vaping on the TFA lemon 2% version now and can't get enough. 
 Not a shake and vape, but I rarely see someone else using TFA Vanilla custard, so have one of my secret recipes. I call it red custard and it needs a week or two to be worth a shit but at some point it starts to smell like a Werther's Original and tastes amazing. 
**The Red Custard by /u/Koniferus**
* 7.75% TFA Vanilla Custard
* 7.75% TFA Bavarian Cream
* 3% TFA Ripe Strawberry
Everyone tastes ejuices differently than me, so maybe this is shit, but if you do make it please let me know how it tasted after steeping. 
 How much different is the TFA Vanilla Custard from CAP? 
 Looks pretty awesome. I've never used BC at a high percentage before I'll have to try.

 Obligatory: taste is subjective mheeerherherm... 
 [deleted] 
 Oh I personally don't think cake batter is custary at all. In fact, I think the taste is remini*scent* of taking a sip of a really old water bottle to see if its good yet. That, mixed with some cake batter. 
 Mix it up dude, tastes exactly like the strawberry custard from white label and a few others. I made it a few times using CAP vanilla custard and it is better with the cake batter IMO 
 [deleted] 
 [removed] 
 [deleted] 
 I personally think that CAP Cake Batter and CAP Vanilla Custard are very similar flavors pre-steeped. After a while they diverge into different tastes but not for a week or two. 
 ill be mixing this up later today! gonna sub in some pear and some blackberry and report back to this sub soon 
 What kind of PG/VG ratio should I use for this? 
 Anything should work but I stick with 70vg. 
 This is great because I have a buddy that vapes this stuff all day everyday, I make it with TFA green apple @ 4% Straw 10@ and peach  5% 
 Great recipe, I took inspiration from this and made:
6% TFA - Strawberry Ripe 
4.5% TFA - Green Apple
4% TFA - Juicy Peach
2.5% Capella - Sweet Strawberry
2% TFA - Koolada
1% TFA - Dragonfruit
Really enjoying it so far, shake and vape approved!
 
 I may increase the Peach by .5% and reduce the cap sweet strawberry by .5% nice mix. 
 This is a great recipe but for those (like me) who aren't crazy for the chocolate, drop the chocolate glazed donut down to 5% and add 2% Bavarian Cream and it tastes 100% like a  Boston cream donut. 
 Would you still consider it a shake-and-vape? 
 For me, definitely. But I've never had any bad taste or anything from Bavarian cream right off the bat other than delicious shake n vape tastiness.  
 Honestly, I wouldn't consider this a shake-and-vape at all, despite the certification. I didn't like it at first - seemed harsh - then tried it a week later and it was super-nummy. 
 I agree, but I am leaving it here since it seems many consider it a go-to shake and vape recipe. Just because it is a shake and vape does not mean it doesn't get better with time ;) 
 I'm hoping it isnt a shake and vape honestly. Made it for the first time and I think it's broverrated. Hopefully it gets better. The actual doughnut flavor is quite strong while the chocolate and glaze doesn't seem to be popping out very well.  
 Many on /r/DIY_EJUICE agree that it is a shake and vape, but your experience matches mine. I honestly hate the chocolate. I think it tastes a lot like chocolate jellybeans (which are good, but not something I want as an ADV). After a week it was palatable, but I much prefer using glazed donut over chocolate glazed. I'm working on a recipe for that one right now that might end up here if it qualifies. 
 It's growing on me. Been vaping it all day just to give it a fair chance. I think it tastes exactly like a chocolate iced donut, not necessarily a chocolate glazed. The chocolate is probably the best chocolate flavor I've vaped. Most of them are plain awful. I think it is the joy that isn't sitting too well right off the bat. Almost harsh. Its not bad, but it is definitely not in my top 5. It has room for improvement. Hopefully it steeps well. Also gonna try the Bavarian cream version because I love me some BC. 
 [deleted] 
 Go check right now. I Just ordered 
 10% seems super strong on the chai (cap) I use that one at 2% in a mix and can taste all the spices individually. Just my 2 cents. Not trying to talk down.  
 Looks like the recipe actually calls for TFA which is most likely weaker than CAP. Not sure though, never used Chai tea. 
 It is super dominating. But I think as a single flavor it might work well.  
 Thanks for putting these ideas here. I presume I'm using TFA as I just mixed with .1 Signature Chai Spiced & .03 TFA Cinnamon Spice. So far, so good. I'll add more feedback before too long. 
     I've never used either of these at this high of a percentage, it's so far been an interesting vape even for that alone. I have been somewhat let down by this chai flavor previously; it seems more like cola than the chai's I've known. I like the flavor but the name seems misapplied IMO.
Days later: I'm looking forward to trying a more authentic chai flavoring. I've had better results with PG & tea.  After 20+ ml of this, it pretty much just tastes like cinnamon spice and cola to me. I like cinnamon spice and cola. I've mixed the two of these plenty previously, I was hoping I found a great ratio here but it doesn't really do much for me that cinnamon spice doesn't take care of on it's own. It's a nice way to sweeten it up though. It's easy enough to vape, doesn't feel like a chai though.
 
 i have some 4mg vaporshark juice? 
 Send me inbox 
 I have some 3mg Praxis by Amber (I've posted a separate thread in juiceswap) - if you'd like 
 Cool 
 Is there anything you'd be willing to swap? PM me and we'll sort something out if so 
 Have an apple pie a la mode 6mg 
 got loads of 6mg mainly in 80/20 mix but I've probably got around 100 different liquids
 
 I'm not sure i understand.  do you just want someone to ship you vapor chef? and your are offering a 30ml bottle to do so? if so i would do that for you.  I'm guessing you're paying for shipping?
EDIT: sorry I'm new to juice swap - just read the info on the side bar, and now i understand.  Do you know if it's legally available for import? 
 I'd be willing to help out! PM me. 
 I still have this ;) 
 I'll be in ffm this Monday, I can pick up some as 9sv is my local b&m.  Let me know what you wanna do.
Cheers

I live in Australia and got mine from them. 
 hello, i hope it's ok that i just post here. Was wondering if you have any experience with customs office in germany regarding international shippings of juice? i'll have to get a parcel from USA to pick up here in a german customs office and a little worried about if they will let me have it at all. 
 so how did it go 
 went fine! just had to open the parcel, they had a look, and then i had to pay the 20% taxes. 
 I'm willing to help. Sending a PM. 
 Just got the package. /u/colonelk0rn went above and beyond to help out - great guy, highly recommended. 11/10, will do again. 
 I have 120 ml if interested if you are in need of more 
 Just a heads up, you can label an international package as a gift but you still have to list the contents and value on a customs declarations form.  As long as the juice is legal there you shouldn't have any issue.  
 If you are looking for someone to drop ship for you, I would be more than willing to help with that. Although they are currently sold out 
 I can help, I'll send you a pm 
 Still got them? I've got a couple bottles I might be down to trade or I'll straight up buy them from you. 
 Yeah. What do you have? 
 Not sure if you got any replies, but I'd be willing to do what I could to help. I participated in the Secret Santa, and got matched up with a fellow in NZ. Took forever to get his package to him, but that was partially due to the postal service being on holiday.
Send me a PM. 
 You might have better luck on http://www.reddit.com/r/ecigclassifieds/
This sub is more for vapers outside of US looking to buy American juice. 
 Oh thank you, I did not know that.  
 what is the flavor description? I have some mostly full 10mL bottles I got in a VapeWild sample pack that I personally didn't like. I can get the names for you if you're interested 
edit: didn't notice this was posted almost a month ago. lmao oops, I'll leave the comment tho  
 Haha I still have it.  It's chocolate and mint with a little cranberry.  It came out for Christmas and then that was it.  I really dont like it O_O. 
 What flavor is that like? I have two mad town vape 15ml 12mg. It's peanut butter banana and peaches and berries.  
 It looks like [this](http://www.blowingvapors.com/tally-ho-vapor-tonic-liturgy-e-liquid/) may be the juice in question. From the description, it sounds like it's a blueberry cheesecake type flavor. 
 You're welcome /u/hakoo178, just let me know if you ever need to put in another order. 
 I am interested. I have a a bottle of sng vapor and a bottle of mbv vapor juice.
The MBV vapor is 555 is 6mg strength and the SNG vapor is Nutty Cocoa is 12 mg. Both have been opened but are 98% full.
 
 The nutty cocoa is a possibility. How much do you have and what flavours are you looking for? 
 I have 20mls of it. Can you make nana' cream? I really want to try that. 
 Yea find me a recipe and I'll knock it up for you. I'll need to order some supplies  
 I dont know how easy it is to get these ingredients in the UK but if its too difficult I don't mind any other diy juice you have.

5.0% LA Banana Cream
3.0% TFA Dragon Fruit
7.0% TFA Strawberry
1 drop per mL Citric Acid
Mix at 30pg / 70vg
 
 I've already made my monthly order for concentrates now. If I can get all those next month, I'll knock you up a bottle and post it your way  
 Can i jump in on this? Swap for 10ml of Heisenberg from vampire vapes. 
 I only have 30ml bottles and paying �5 postage to get 10ml of juice isn't something that would be practical for me.  
 OK mate thanks anyway! 
 Thanks. PM me your address and ill post the nutty cocoa out to you. 
 Interested in trading 30ml? I have Spider Venom but I hate it. 6mg. 
 I have a 20ml bottle of sng vapor - 555 6mg. I wouldnt mind swapping for 20ml of your juice. 
 If you live in China look up Vapina Vape Club based outta Guangzhou. They have some social media circles and an active wechat group. Everyone is super friendly and there are many up and coming retailers/wholesalers there. I am getting tons of super nice, exotic, and safe ejuices from them (the ones I buy are imported from Florida). I've met many of them face to face and can verify they are trustworthy and their products authentic. 
 Shipping from me to sweden is roughly $17.
Is there any particular reason why you want Nude Nicotine? I've always gotten mine from Wizardlabs and I've only had excellent feedback from the quality. I'm not trying to sway your decision here, merely see if there is some reasoning behind it that might sway mine :)
What size bottle were you thinking? 
 No special reason, only that I've heard great stuff about them, and I am having a hard time finding a nicotine base that I am not sensitive to. So basically I am trying out lots and lots of vendors. 
Would also be interested in trying out the nic from Wizardlabs if you say it is good quality.
I was mainly thinking about getting a bottle of 120ml 100mg/ml and 1000ml of pure VG and maybe some flavorings.
Would really appreciate if you can make this happen :) and also if you have the possibility to send me a small sample of your nic-base, that would be awesome! 
 Based off of experience, I would advise going ahead and investing in a gallon jug of VG. It's significantly cheaper in the long run, and you'll go through a lot more than a liter if you plan on using 120mL of 100mg/mL. Due to the weight though, I'd advise getting your VG local if possible. I use eBay to get food grade VG and PG.
Wizardlabs is an excellent source for trying out flavors because you can get 8mL bottles for $1.50. Just come up with a list of what you would like to try.
While I can send you a sample of my nicotine base, I'll go ahead and say that I've had it for a while and it's degraded to almost half of the original concentration. It doesnt really affect mixing besides the fact that you have to double the amount of nicotine base you put in.  
 Sounds like a plan then, was thinking that the quality of the VG also had something to do with the problems I am experiencing. But as a first step the nicotine from them will be fine. If we could arrange that I would be very thankful.  Should we settle the rest in PM? Will take a look at wizardlabs flavors and shoot you a message.. 
 Sounds good just shoot me a message. 
 Bombies, The Vapor Chef, Steamy Vapor, Mt Baker Vapor (I suggest sticking with just their best sellers). These are just to name a few. The list is a long one. 
Check out juicedb.com for vendors rating, specific vendor juice ratings/descriptions, and up to date coupons.  
 Seconding this list of recommendations, and most of these ship to Canada. Bombies is the best and ships discreetly (so you don't have to worry about anything getting seized at the border), but if you want to order Bombies within Canada (much faster shipping) you can at DashVapes! 
 I can recommend Halycon vapors for sure. Cran Chi is an ADV easily.  
 Halcyon Vapors is amazing, Apa'chi is the best. 
 Bombies, space jam, suicide bunny, whit. E. Octopus, cosmic fog, the vapor chef, velvet cloud vapour, are ones i can call off my head. Check out giantvapes.com they have a few of those brands. 
 Any good samaritan would like to ship them to me? Most of them don't ship to Canada. I'd pay the shipping and give you a tip! 
 Pm me. If you can order and have it delivered to me I'll mail it on to you.  
 Thanks for the kind words! 
 I'm in Japan and have a bunch of juices I'd like to give away or swap with someone else in Japan. 
 I can help, if it's still needed. 
 Thank you very much, but /u/samdamanzo helped me already. I have to thank him a lot! 
 No problem. If you need help in the future, just shoot me a PM.  
 Go ahead and pm me. I'd be willing to help 
 Bombies 'Nana Cream 
 I don't have any to trade, but for fruity flavors I like Bombies and Velvet Cloud. 
 Thanks! Now I gotta figure out how to get those in Canada :D 
 I'm all about the fruity, non-sweet flavours myself and bombies' seven seas is my adv and favourite with tiger style coming in as a close second. Pretty sure they would deliver to Canada as they deliver to Ireland. :) 
 Pm me.  
 US shipping IS expensive. You're not going to save much if anything. And it will be week and half late, well steeped though. First class international from the US is a bit cheaper but is very slow. 
 What country you in ?
 
 What nic level?  
 Im ok with anything up to 18mg, the lower the better though :) 
 PM me your address. I have some I can send you :) 
 PM'd :) 
 Hey Suds
I have 30ml of Alien Visions Strawberry Cheesecake.  I hate it, and can't stand the taste.  I have used only 3ml of the 30ml and I would trade you for anything.  I hate this flavor. 
 Hello fellow shibe :) 
 Hello Shibe! Are you just stopping by for greetings, or is there anything I can do for ya?  (unfortunately i got frustrated and gave away the cucumber mint already.. tasted too much like pickles) 
 Just stopping by, kind sir :3 
 We send people here all the time so hopefully one of our international fans sees this!  
 And i have :) 
 
 
Thanks. I've been hearing a lot about TVC and have been dying to try 'em. I live in India. Will that be possible for you? And any idea how much the shipping will cost? Thanks so much again.  
 Yeah they have done of the best mixes. Black Pom Pom is awesome. Not sure about shipping cost though. 
 Shipping to Australia please :) 
 Hey man are you still looking for some help with getting some VTNW? 
 Yes, please :) 
 Sure thing, just send me a pm with what juices and nicotine levels you want and we'll get this rolling.

 Unicorn Poop is just about my favorite flavor in the world right now. 
 Reading reviews of it, im not getting the raspberry or blueberry flavours, just a nice cookie flavour. Did you steep it at all for these to develop?  
 Not even a minute. I get more of a blue raspberry than a blueberry and raspberry though.  
 Much appriciated as always /u/JordanFox2

 Yeah wasn't expecting it for another few days at least, happy days! 
 How much did that cost you? 
 With shipping to the uk was �55/$90 
 not too bad i guess. 
 I get excited at work seeing Jordan Fox's name on an invoice because that means someone far away is getting something awesome! 
Hope you love that liquid. It looks so majestic in the window sill!

 How close to canada are you? 
 Not exactly close, Southern California. 
 Too far west for me.
Thanks anyway! 
 hey. so any leads or suppliers? 
 I found some at http://www.aromaejuice.com/Unflavored-DIY-Whole-Tobacco-Alkaloid-WTA-Bottle-unflavDIYWTA.htm
You can try contacting them to see if they ship to Australia. 
There is a sub called /r/aussievapers.  You can try asking your question there. 
 just asking where I can please purchase unflavoured wta liquid for vapor and where they ship to australia 
 Please excuse my lack of reddiquette. I have only just registered with Reddit, a couple of hours ago. I don't quite understand it. Lmho...  
 It's not a lack of reddiquette. It's that you're posting a picture in a place dedicating to swapping juice. I just don't see your purpose. 
 I would be happy to help. PM me. 
 What do you need? PM :)

 I can help you out if you need this still, shoot me a PM and we can work it out. 
 lol thanks for the love man, enjoy that juice!  
 Hey there, just wondering, how is the package sent? I just found this subreddit and would love to get some juices but many stores won't send to Mexico, I tried once buying something and sending it to a friends' house in the US but when he send it to me I received a call from UPS I think (don't recall the company) telling me that since in Mexico is illegal to get this products they would go into abandonment and there was nothing I could do to either send them back or get them here, so I'm not really sure what did we do wrong and if there's a better way to send them.
Thanks to both of you in advance, awesome subreddit! :D

 I'm looking to refill my stash, nice offer.  
 oh wow, that's quite the loot! may i ask, what does unicorn poop tastes like? 
 [deleted] 
 have you tried steeping it? just leaving it open for about a week? sometimes with certain flavors you need to steep them so that their 'real' flavor comes out. 
 This sub is for people outside the US to get hooked up with someone in the US so they can ship them juice from vendors who do not currently offer international shipping. 
You should try posting over at /r/ecigclassifieds if you ever want to buy/sell/trade your vape gear. And just be sure to read the sidebar for info on a sub when ya first go to one.  They usually give ya a good idea of what the subreddit is. Good luck! 
 Hey I'd be happy to help you out! I'll PM you and we can go over details  
 Hope you enjoy it! No more perfume juice for you buddy! 
 This belongs in /r/ecigclassifieds. 
This sub is more for people outside the US who wanna order from US vendors who do not have international shipping. They get with someone who is willing to ship their order to them. Ecigclassifieds on the other hand, does trades and whatnot.  
 Good on you!

 What about out to Australia? 
 Sure thing, just follow the instructions on the side bar of juice swap, if I need to place the order for you, I can, just let me know what you want from what vendor and I'll let you know what the actual shipping charge will be. 
 Pm'ing 
 Once you get Honey Pearry get  ready to sit back and close your eye's as the pear hits you first and then the honeydew mellon lingers afterwards it's amazing and one of my favorite flavors to vape. 
 I can't wait! ;) 
 I live in the Netherlands and want to get my hands on Vapor Chef liquids too!! Lets co-order!? 
 Ive sent a few packages to Sydney and some to other parts of Australia, Western Australia etc... I always sent my packages standard USPS and I always just put that is a gift and put flavorings as the description on the customs form.  I have never had an issue (knock on wood) with any of my packages getting to their destination. Plus, since its a gift,  no one ever had to pay a duty or anything.

 From experience standard usps delivery is fine. Fedex were a pain in the ass.  
 Thanks guys, appreciate the advice.  
 I live in Sydney and never had any issues with importing juice, or having others ship it to me. Regular mail works just fine. 
 Anyone know a rough estimate of the time a USPS shipping takes to Sydney? 
 I like the idea. I think successful requester is fine. Its direct and too the point.

 Yes this happens a decent amount. Its lovely when the person has a bunch of questions and I spend a bunch of time explaining how everything will go and then after all that, thats when they give ya the i'll get back to you in a week when I get paid line. 
But, all in all, the excitement and gratitude shown by those who do go through with it makes it all worthwhile.
